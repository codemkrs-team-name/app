FOREST was born in Washington State in 1955. His family moved to Southern California where he grew up in the Pasadena area. At the age of 16 he quit school and went to Hawaii where he survived by picking shell fish on the coastal cliffs and selling them to the Japanese fish merchants, cleaning Hotels and picking pineapple on the Dole plantation.\n \n Upon returning to the mainland he studied violin and harmonica. A six month trip to the Virgin Islands after hitchhiking to New York added to the resume of already some 30 jobs he'd had, ranging from fishing salmon in the Northern Pacific, constuction, oil refinery tank-scraping, roofing and electrician's assistant.\n \n Andy studied music, dance, Latin and fencing at Pasadena Junior College when he was 18. During this time he focused on blues harmonica, which would later lead to a recording career. Moving to New Orleans in 1974 he received a scholarship at a local dance company. Between waiting tables at Brennan's and playing harmonica with local bands he began to experiment with poetry and songwriting.\n \n 1977 found Andy on a three month trip to Europe that lasted over ten years. He recorded the first of 13 albums in 1979, consistantly writing 90% of the material. Touring extensively in Europe he returned to New Orleans periodically to record his songs and play in clubs. In Italy, he began teaching harmonica seminars and master classes and interviewing rock stars for Italian television as his Italian became fluent.\n \n A casting agent in Rome saw him playing in a club in 1985 which led to a twelve film, five year acting career. He landed lead roles acting next to Toshiro Mifune, Irene Pappas, Ernest Borgnine and many others. He shot films in the Moroccan Sahara Desert, Yugoslavia, Brazil, Canada, on the Orinoco River in Venezuela and in Italy. The films ranged from B war movies to arty erotica (Tinto Brass) and brilliant comedy to Safari films for Japanese television. Forest also has a dozen TV commercials to his credit as an actor and one as a writer.\n \n Not satisfied with his dialogue he began to re-write a lot of his lines and eventually wrote film ideas that he wound up molding into short stories, preferring the literary form over film script. By 1990 he had begun to develop a writing style and abandoned cinema for a full time touring schedule. The music had become just as lucrative and more artistically satisfying.\n \n In 1997 Forest entered a short story and a poem in the William Faulkner Creative Writing Competition in New Orleans and was a finalist in both catagories. With this encouragement he has taken writing more seriously. In the winter of 1997-98 writing between Bourbon Street gigs and tours, he completed his first. The novel was short listed for an award in the 1998 Faulkner Competition and was published for Pengragon Press in January 1999. The French translation was published by the prestigious Editions Gallimard (Serie Noir) in 2003. The soundtrack or companion CD on Appaloosa Records has the same title as the novel. \n \n What started out as a hobby has almost become a second career for Andy. Since the winter of 2000 he has been drawing and painting. The first art show was in 2001 at Eugene's Gallery on Royal Street in New Orleans followed by a show in Ferrara (Italy) and then Paris France. The Sonny Boy Williamson Museum in Helena Arkansas has several and the House of Blues art department has aquired several dozen from Andy. La Belle Gallery (see link) has a small collection and the legendary New Orleans restaurant &quot;Jaquimo's&quot; has a few of Forest's acrylic portaits on it's walls as well.\n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/69523122.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/69523122.jpg", "name": "Andy Rogers", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Andy+Rogers", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/34/69523122.jpg", "mbid": "592136ef-86f7-433a-9913-0969cc8d3825", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Anthony Ray", "tags": "r,e,g,g,a,e", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Anthony+Ray", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "c9ae787a-0bbe-4b15-9f35-fbe4e4491852", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/84756707.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/84756707.jpg", "name": "ArchAnimals", "tags": "modest mouse,america,new orleans,archers of loaf,archanimals", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/ArchAnimals", "bio_summary": "Winter tour dates above~!!!  ^  \n ", "image_small": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/34/84756707.jpg", "mbid": "", "bio_content": "Winter tour dates above~!!!  ^\n \n \n \n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/46612045.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/46612045.jpg", "name": "Aside Oceans", "tags": "alternative rock,modern rock", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Aside+Oceans", "bio_summary": "Southwest VA offers cool mountain air, all four seasons, and the best southern hospitality you can ask for.

All you have to know about these guys is the fanatical following of &quot;Gumbo Heads&quot; that numbers in the thousands. They drive hundreds of miles to get a serving of Big Al and the Heavyweights musical gumbo. You see, Big Al and the Heavyweights is an unconventional original music band that hails from New Orleans, LA. Why Big Al himself is from The Big Easy. That is where he grew up, surrounded by the sounds of New Orleans music - Jazz, Blues, Zydeco, Cajun, Rock, and Swamp Pop. It is these influences that make Heavyweight music so accessible and fun. Big Al and the Heavyweights will be on the road 200+ days this year, and it is this regimen of hard touring for the last six years that has made them one of the most well known, original bands in any musical format. \n \n The membership of Big Al and the Heavyweights starts with Big Al himself from New Orleans on drums and vocals, James Bass from Baton Rouge on lead guitar \\vocals, Dean &quot;The Bass Machine&quot; Galatas from Bayou Liberty on bass and Harmonica Red also from Baton Rouge on harmonica\\vocals. \n \n Born and raised in New Orleans, LA, Al is a real New Orleanian, going to Mardi Gras after Mardi Gras, seeing the sights of Mardi Gras through the eyes of a child. That same wonderment and jubilation comes through Heavyweight music - the music that helps people forget about the news du jour. None other than head Blues Brother, Dan Akroyd, has described Al as the &quot;pounding, driving force&quot; of Heavyweight music. Incidentally, Dan is a big supporter of the Heavyweights, playing all three of their CD's on his syndicated House of Blues Radio Show. They even play at the Chicago House of Blues for 2 to 3 nights in a row three times a year! But Dan Akroyd is not the only high profile celeb that knows the power of Big Al - Chef Emeril Lagasse tapped them to be musical guests for his season premier of Emeril Live! \n \n Band History\n \n Big Al and The Heavyweights began in 1992 as the Unknown Blues Band with founding members Warren Haynes and Al Lauro. The two met performing in country outlaw, David Allan Coe\u2019s Band. They quickly found a common interest and that was their love of music especially the blues. Soon they put together the U.B.B and began performing at small clubs and festivals. The band began getting notoriety for their lengthy sets and their ability to fuse their many musical influences into a powerful brand of blues. \n \n The band started opening for many acts. One such act was B. L. T., which included Dickey Betts, Chuck Leavall, and Butch Trucks. Dickey Betts was truly inspired by Warren's incredible guitar prowess and soulful vocals and offered him a gig in a band he was putting together. Naturally, Warren took the gig and the rest is history. He went on to become a major force in The Allman Brothers Band in which he currently plays as well as his own band, Gov't Mule. As for Big Al, he had lost an incredible guitarist and vocalist but never a friend. The only thing left to do was to move on and that he did; putting together a new band and landing a record deal with Scott Mullins' Rollin and Tumblin Records to create Big Al and The Heavyweights. Big Al and band began touring the country relentlessly focusing the band's sound more on his Louisiana roots and the music that began being called &quot;Gumbo Grooves&quot;. Their first CD, &quot;That Ain't Nice&quot;, received critical acclaim from all the major blues societies and publications. Finally, the big break came when Dan Aykroyd featured the band's song &quot;House Party&quot; on his House of Blues Radio Show as the Blues Breaker of the Week. Next, the CD was nominated for Blues Album of the Year by one of largest entertainment organizations in the U.S., the Nashville Entertainment Association. The band was honored to having been nominated along with fellow nominees: Roscoe Shelton, Earl Gaines, and Jimmy Hall (who won) formerly of the famous southern rock band, Wet Willie. The band's next CD was recorded on the Bluziana Music record label and was entitled &quot;Hey, Hey Mardi Gras&quot;. Once again, number one Blues Brother Dan Aykroyd took notice and featured the song &quot;Cajun Roux&quot; on his House of Blues Radio Show garnering the band even more attention. &quot;Hey, Hey Mardi Gras&quot; was also nominated for a Nammy Award for Blues Album of the Year by the N. E. A. along with Delbert McClinton (who won), Johnny Jones, and Bonnie Raitt guitarist, Rick Vito. \n \n After a web broadcast from the famous J &amp; J Blues Bar in Ft. Worth, TX The band kept getting requests for a live CD. Hence, they recorded &quot;Live Crawfish&quot; captures the band with all their energy and power. It was very well received and also featured on the House of Blues Radio Show &quot;Late Night Gumbo Party&quot; was recorded with noted blues producer, Fred James, at the helm. Fred has worked with KoKo Taylor, Johnny Winter, Charlie Mussellwhite and Son Seals. &quot;Late Night Gumbo Party&quot; once again caught the ear of Dan Aykroyd and he featured the song, &quot;Hey, Hey Nanette&quot; as the Blues Breaker of the Week. He also interviewed Big Al on the show. The CD charted at # 4 on the Living Blues play list charts. Here's what Living Blues says in reviewing &quot;Late Night Gumbo Party&quot;, &quot;If you're missing the sultry, sticky Crescent City scene and want a quick fix, this CD is for you. &quot; Bruce Iglauer, the president and founder of Alligator Records produced the current Cd, \u201cNothin But Good Lovin\u201d. It is the bands most eclectic record and has truly defined the band\u2019s sound. \n \n &quot;Emeril Cooks Up Some Gumbo Grooves&quot;\n The Food Network's, Emeril Lagasse, heard a copy of &quot;Hey, Hey Mardi Gras&quot; and loved it. He had the producers of his show, &quot;Emeril Live&quot;, get in touch with the band about a performance on his Mardi Gras show. It was the premier show of the season and the seventh most popular show on cable television for the week with a viewership of 43 million people across the U.S. The response from the show was nothing short of amazing. Bluziana Music had to rush to have more copies of the CD pressed just to keep up with the internet and mail orders. That exposure has earned the band much deserved recognition and spots on some of the biggest festivals in the country. The band has also been featured on the Cajun and Creole cooking shows of &quot;Emeril Live.&quot; \n \n Song Writing Recognition and Mardi Gras Records\n \n Recently, Alligator Records had their award winning artist, Michael Burks, record &quot;Make It Rain&quot; for his premier release for the label and the cd's title track. Zydeco's reining king, C. J. Chenier, has recorded &quot;Eat More Crawfish&quot; for his Alligator CD, Step It Up. Soul legends, Earl Gaines Johnny Jones and Charles Walker recorded the band\u2019s songs \u201cWhy Can\u2019t We Be Alone\u201d and \u201cWrestlin with the Blues\u201d. The band is also featured on a new compilation CD entitled; &quot;Ultimate Mardi Gras&quot; on New Orleans based Mardi Gras Records. Other artists on the CD are Professor Longhair, Earl King, The Rebirth Brass Band and Rockin Dopsie. \n \n In closing, when speaking of Big Al and the Heavyweights, they can best be summed up by saying they are a real band. They are a band that does it the old fashioned way - club-by-club, fan-by-fan. They have an active mailing list that numbers over 7,000 names. From Maine to Key West, Corpus Christi to New York City and every place in-between.\n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/48428485.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/48428485.jpg", "name": "Big Sam's Funky Nation", "tags": "funk,brass,new orleans,jam cruise 10,soul", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Big+Sam%27s+Funky+Nation", "bio_summary": " \n BIG SAM'S FUNKY NATION: Presiding over his Funky Nation is Big Sam, formerly the trombonist for the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, who blows the funk out of his trombone and refuses to let the audience sit still.

Both were looking to supplement this gig with something a little less structured. \u201cHarry sets the bar pretty high, and you have to play it the same way every night for everyone to follow.\u201d\n \n The big chance came in the summer of \u201998, when Mullins had a weekly residency at Tipitina\u2019s in the French Quarter. The club was then turning weekly slots over to some of the city\u2019s favorite musicians, including Allen Toussaint and Cyril Neville; Mullins got charge of Wednesdays. Word got out one week that he and Klein were staging their trombone super-session and everybody they knew wanted to get involved. \u201cIt seemed that half the trombone players in town showed up,\u201d Klein recalls. \u201cAt the end of the night we had them all onstage, maybe fifteen trombones at once. It sounded like a freight train; a big wall of sound coming right at you.\u201d\n \n Along with his jazz connections, Mullins is Bonerama\u2019s resident rock \u2018n\u2019 roller: It was Mullins who instigated the offbeat classic-rock covers that have become a band tradition. Edgar Winter\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein\u201d was the first nugget to get the treatment and songs by Hendrix, Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and the Allman Brothers Band have since appeared in their set right alongside the funk and jazz-flavored numbers. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely something about the guitar and the trombone that are related,\u201d Mullins figures. \u201cYou compare the fretboard to the slide; there\u2019s a lot of similarity there.\u201d Indeed, the sounds Mullins makes by playing through a guitar amp and wah-wah pedal may explain why he\u2019s named Jimi Hendrix as one of his favorite trombonists. \u201cIt\u2019s great to grab people with the rock songs, and then turn them on to some New Orleans music at the same time,\u201d Klein says. \n \n The buzz on Bonerama grew with hometown acclaim (with the band winning numerous OffBeat Magazine Awards; and Mullins regularly topping OffBeat\u2019s trombone category), lots of roadwork, and three live albums \u2013 the first recorded close to home at the Old Point in Algiers; the second on tour in New York and the third album, Bringing It Home, recorded live from New Orleans\u2019 world famous nightclub, Tipitina\u2019s. The Boston Herald called them a \u201cbonehead\u2019s dream\u201d; the Vail (CO) Daily noted that \u201cthe sound is fat and wet; sometimes downright lusty.\u201d As hometown music zine OffBeat put it, \u201cThat nerdy kid in the band room with the trombone just might have the last laugh after all.\u201d \n \n The new EP Hard Times contains four studio tracks including the title track, \u201cHard Times,\u201d the instrumental number \u201cFolly\u201d and \u201cLost My House\u201d which was co-written by Craig Klein and Dave Malone from the Radiators. These three new originals along with a cover of Led Zeppelin's &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; marks the band's first ever studio recordings. A bonus fifth track features a live performance of &quot;Turn on Your Love Light&quot; captured live from the stage at The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. \n \n \u201c\u2019Lost My House\u2019 is a true story inspired by the levee failures in 2005. The verse was written by Dave Malone, who knows the story of the Rugalator. In the song, it is symbolic of losing everything, but still having the things you love and cherish. Some things can't be taken away,&quot; says Klein. \n \n \u201cThe song \u201cHard Times\u201d is really about the antithesis of hard times and flipping our fears over to optimism. To those that say all hell is breaking loose, we say kick out the demons and embrace all the positives that are always around us but often ignored in this world,&quot; says Mullins.\n \n <a href=\"http://www.BoneramaMusic.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.BoneramaMusic.com</a>\n \n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Borgessa", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Borgessa", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Brass-A-Holics", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Brass-A-Holics", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Brass-A-Holics", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Brass-A-Holics", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Brian Jack & the Zydeco Gamblers", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Brian+Jack+&+the+Zydeco+Gamblers", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/53754275.png", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/53754275.png", "name": "Broadway", "tags": "post-hardcore,screamo,metalcore,rock,post hardcore", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Broadway", "bio_summary": "There are three artists that have used this name:\n 1.

In 1995 Acu\u00f1a made the move to New York City to fulfill her dreams, where she immediately became a fixture at local jam sessions and stints at infamous New York haunts with pianist Harry Whitaker at Arturo's and guitarist Ron Affif at the Zinc Bar. It was at the Greenwich Village hotbed of up-and-coming talent, Small's, where Acu\u00f1a befriended pianist Jason Lindner, her closest collaborator to this day.\n \n Acu\u00f1a was signed to Verve Records in 1999, and recorded her critically acclaimed debut WIND FROM THE SOUTH, followed by the much welcomed follow-up, RHYTHM OF LIFE.

After releasing one 12&quot; on their own label, they disbanded; and Darren went on to work with 'Armshouse Crew' of 'We Are E' fame... this was to last for a further two years.\n \n In 1995 Darren met Jason Maldini through a mutual friend and was soon to be working alongside him at Trouble On Vinyl. In 1996 whilst experimenting with beats the pair wrote their first release on Renegade Hardware - which had been set up purely as a result of this new symbolic sound. This 12\ufffd was Flash Gordon/Jeep Beats. During this period, many such anthems were to emerge including Dead By Dawn, Constant (a collaboration with the infinitely naughty DJ Fierce), and The Germ (under the guise of Genoforce with fellow ex-Hardware artist Genotype).\n \n It was during this period that Daniel Stein AKA Fresh was beginning his apprenticeship in the camp, and similar ideas were leading to collaborations with the pair, the first and last of which to be released on Hardware was The Code and Fugitive before differences with management led all three leaving Hardware for new beginnings. It was here that Fresh introduced Darren and Jason to Michael Wojcicki AKA Vegas and Bad Company UK began in earnest.\n \n Founded in the summer of 1998, Bad Company UK began on the philosophy of re-energizing what was becoming an increasingly minimalist musical genre and convey through their music the same spirit and intensity which first drew them to the sound. Thus one of Drum &amp; Bass' biggest anthems The Nine was born on the (then fledgling) label BC Recordings. Five years on this seminal release still maintains its mighty status.\n \n Propelled by the success of The Nine, the four members soon found their collective gaining momentum with releases on prominent labels including Prototype, Virus, DSCI4, Ram, React and Formation. Within two years Bad Company UK had cemented their name in the foundations of Drum &amp; Bass with the release of their first of several long players, titled Inside The Machine. This album received world-wide acclaim, not only based on the strength and individuality of the music but also the unique concepts behind it.\n \n From this point Bad Company UK (the group and the concept) began to snowball into heights of musical notoriety never before reached by a drum &amp; bass artist, featuring in such notable periodicals as The Face, NME, DJ Magazine, Musik, Dazed and Confused and Mixmag. During this time the foursome insisted on bypassing the path leading to mainstream success, instead opting to fuel the underground. This way of thinking was embodied in the birth of flagship internet forum <a href=\"http://www.dogsonacid.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.dogsonacid.com</a>. This gave fans and fellow artists alike the opportunity to express opinions, contribute ideas and greatly strengthened d&amp;b's global community. This web forum has become an important (and previously) unheard voice of the scene. With an average of 2 million visitors on a typical weekend it is a mighty voice indeed.\n \n Fast forward 3 albums, 11 singles, 3 weeks at the top of the UK dance album charts, countless remixes, 4 world tours and uncountable late night studio sessions spent creating d&amp;b classics such as The Pulse, Planet Dust, Spacehopper, Dogs on The Moon, Mo' Fire, Seizure, Torpedo and Hornet and you arrive-somewhat exhaustedly-at the present.\n \n 2003 has seen many major changes within BC camp and more notably in D-Bridge's musical direction. Whilst the most recent album Shot Down on Safari was in production Darren was also busy at work co-producing Spacek's second album 'Vintage High-tech' on high-profile label !K7. Heralded as the Radiohead of soul and described by Rolling Stone as &quot;a group that gives new meaning to the phrase space funk\ufffd, Spacek define a new generation of British soul music, harnessing the power of today's electronic mediums to create a vintage sound. Vintage High-tech has since gone on the receive rapturous praise from the US Hip Hop/RnB scene, celebrated by artists such as Mos Def, Dwele, The Roots, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Jay Dee and Vikter Duplaix. D-Bridge's contribution to this album spawned a new direction for him and led to the founding, alongside his brother and Spacek co-member Morgan Zarate of The Istickz, a self-described 'futuristic/simplistic' soul group consisting of 5 Producers, 3 DJs, 2 Vocalists and several MPC2000's and laptops.\n \n Hosting an increasingly popular monthly at London venue Plastic People, collaborating with high profile artists like Dwele and an album currently in production on burgeoning Hip Hop label Curvatia Music, Istickz are well on their way to achieving world-wide recognition for their unique brand of UK Soul.\n \n The latest venture in D-Bridge's (now somewhat eclectic) career is the fruition of a lifetime goal in the form of drum &amp; bass label Exit Records. Exit came about as a result of Darren\ufffds desire to be able to express his own individual qualities as a producer, rather than being a contributor to a greater whole. Embarking on a solo effort seems like a natural progression for Darren, who through the success of Bad Company UK, Spacek and more recently with Istickz has managed to create a diverse and inspirational release catalogue of enviable proportions. With a history as varied and colorful as this, who knows what to expect next from D-Bridge?\n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Dan Lippel", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Lippel", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/71166344.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/71166344.jpg", "name": "Dan Rivers", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Rivers", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/34/71166344.jpg", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Dana Abbott", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Dana+Abbott", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/81998111.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/81998111.jpg", "name": "Daniel Bachman", "tags": "american primitive,american primitivism,americana,psych folk,folk", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Daniel+Bachman", "bio_summary": "Daniel Bachman is a 6 string guitar player from Virginia.    <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Daniel+Bachman\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.discogs.com/artist/Daniel+Bachman</a>", "image_small": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/34/81998111.jpg", "mbid": "", "bio_content": "Daniel Bachman is a 6 string guitar player from Virginia.  \n \n <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Daniel+Bachman\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.discogs.com/artist/Daniel+Bachman</a>\n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Daniel Black", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Daniel+Black", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "7fc0c9be-f060-44d2-b333-aaed23edc03c", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Daniel BOURGEOIS", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Daniel+BOURGEOIS", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/611977.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/611977.jpg", "name": "Daniel Thompson", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Daniel+Thompson", "bio_summary": "Daniel Thompson, the deep-voiced singer/songwriter from the NSW Central Coast, scored his second Independent Award winning Male Vocalist of the Year with his remake of the classic (I\u2019m Just A) Country Boy.

With the release of his debut solo album, Quand J'ai Parti in 1991, Doucet successfully stepped into the spotlight. \n \n Doucet first played the guitar after recuperating from a broken arm sustained while practicing with his high school football team. Although he initially taught himself to play by using Bob Dylan and Paul Simon songbooks, Doucet became fascinated with flatpicking after listening to an album by Doc Watson. \n \n Together with his brother and banjo player Raoul Breaux, Doucet played Cajun music in Louisiana clubs in 1975. When the project proved commercially unsuccessful, the band broke up with Doucet enrolling in college and his brother going on to form the Cajun rock band Coteau and the original lineup of Beausoleil. A turning point in Doucet's evolution as a guitarist came when he heard the playing of the late Clarence White on an album, The Kentucky Colonels 1965-1967, in 1980. Inspired by White's use of unusual chords and imaginative melodies, Doucet began to develop his own unique style. \n \n Although Doucet did not play on Beausoleil's first recording session in Paris, he joined the group before the recording of their debut album, The Spirit of Cajun Music, in 1976. \n \n Doucet moved to New Orleans, where he continues to reside, in 1980 to work at the World's Fair. In addition to his solo album and recordings with Beausoleil, Doucet was featured on albums by Chuck Guillory (Grand Texas), Octa Clark &amp; Hector Duhon (Ensemble Encore) and Michael Doucet (Dit BeauSoleil). \n \n Doucet was accompanied on Quand J'ai Parti by members of Beausoleil (Michael Doucet, Jimmy Breaux, Tommy Comeaux, Billy Ware and Tommy Alesi) and influential dobro player Josh Graves, whom he met during a &quot;Legends of Folk Violin&quot; tour. \n \n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/12074085.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/12074085.jpg", "name": "Debbie Davis", "tags": "jazz,blues rock,french pop,disney soundtracks,guitar blues", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Debbie+Davis", "bio_summary": "Debbie Davis (born June 29th 1959 in El Paso,Texas)  is an international singer.

Their lyrics often revolve around the working class trying to survive in economically-depressed small towns of the South.\n \n Co-founded by Patterson Hood (son of bassist <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/David+Hood\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">David Hood</a> of the legendary Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section) and longtime friend and musical partner Mike Cooley in Athens, Georgia, in 1996. The two men had played in various other bands including Adam's House Cat which was chosen as a top ten Best Unsigned Band by a Musician contest in the late 1980s.\n \n Together with a revolving group of musicians, Drive-By Truckers put out their first two albums, <a title=\"Drive-By Truckers - Gangstabilly\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drive-By+Truckers/Gangstabilly\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Gangstabilly</a> (1998) and <a title=\"Drive-By Truckers - Pizza Deliverance\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drive-By+Truckers/Pizza+Deliverance\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Pizza Deliverance</a> (1999). Following their second release, the band embarked on a nationwide tour, resulting in a live album called <a title=\"Drive-By Truckers - Alabama Ass Whuppin'\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drive-By+Truckers/Alabama+Ass+Whuppin%27\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Alabama Ass Whuppin'</a> (released in 2000 by Second Heaven Records, re-released in 2002 by Terminus Records). They had an entertaining and informational website long before most bands had begun taking advantage of the internet as a promotional tool, and together with constant touring, they quickly developed a large and dedicated fan base both on and off-line.\n \n After three years on the road a tight-knit group of musicians emerged and they began work on 2001's <a title=\"Drive-By Truckers - Southern Rock Opera\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drive-By+Truckers/Southern+Rock+Opera\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Southern Rock Opera</a>. Southern Rock Opera is a double album executed as a song cycle. The album loosely uses the rise and literal fall of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lynyrd+Skynyrd\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Lynyrd Skynyrd</a> as a metaphor for the culture of the American South.\n \n Self released on their own Soul Dump Records on September 12, 2001, Southern Rock Opera, quickly accumulated praise from fans and critics alike, including a four-star review in Rolling Stone. To take advantage of the positive reception, Southern Rock Opera was re-issued by Mercury and Lost Highway Records in July 2002. Soon after, Drive-By Truckers were named Band of the Year by No Depression.\n \n Before they could record a follow-up to Southern Rock Opera, guitarist Rob Malone left and was replaced guitarist and songwriter, Jason Isbell. Originally from Greenhill, Alabama, during his five years with Drive-By Truckers, Isbell contributed a number of significant songs to the albums he worked on. \n \n Due to changes at Lost Highway, the Truckers were released from their contract and signed with Austin-based record label New West, for the follow-up to Southern Rock Opera, 2003's  <a title=\"Drive-By Truckers - Decoration Day\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drive-By+Truckers/Decoration+Day\" class=\"bbcode_album\">Decoration Day</a>. Like its predecessor, the album received broad praise from fans and critics alike. Although it isn't a concept album, the songs of Decoration Day explore a common theme of hard decisions in the context of marriage, incest, break-ups, revenge, murder, and suicide are major themes.\n \n After years of producing and playing with Drive-By Truckers, bassist Earl Hicks left the band on December 22, 2003. Hicks was immediately replaced by studio bassist Shonna Tucker, then wife of guitarist Jason Isbell. Tucker had previously guested on Decoration Day playing upright bass on the Cooley-penned track, &quot;Sounds Better in the Song&quot;.\n \n In 2004, Drive-By Truckers released  <a title=\"Drive-By Truckers - The Dirty South\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drive-By+Truckers/The+Dirty+South\" class=\"bbcode_album\">The Dirty South</a>. Like Southern Rock Opera, The Dirty South was a concept album. The Dirty South further explored the mythology of the South, with songs focusing on Sam Phillips and the Sun Records crowd, John Henry and his hammer, and a three-song suite about Sheriff Buford Pusser.\n \n After touring throughout 2004 and 2005, Drive-By Truckers found their way to the Fidelitorium Recording Studio in Forsyth County, North Carolina during late 2005. These recording sessions, once again produced by David Barbe, resulted in the band's seventh LP, A Blessing and a Curse.\n \n Released on April 18, 2006, A Blessing and a Curse showcased Drive-By Truckers' ability to branch out into new territory, and can be seen as the band's attempt at shaking labeling by critics, detractors, fans, and followers, particularly the Southern rock label that has haunted the band since Southern Rock Opera. The album sounds less like Skynyrd, and more closely resembles the bare-bones British rock of the early 1970s such as The Rolling Stones and Faces. Tom Petty's influence on the band's sound is more prominent on this album as well.\n \n In 2006, Drive-By Truckers reunited, both on-stage and on-record, with Athens-based pedal steel guitarist, John Neff. Neff first played with the band on their 1998 debut LP, Gangstabilly, and played pedal steel on three subsequent albums, 1999's Pizza Deliverance, and 2003's Decoration Day. Neff was featured heavily on the 2006 release,  <a title=\"Drive-By Truckers - A Blessing And A Curse\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Drive-By+Truckers/A+Blessing+And+A+Curse\" class=\"bbcode_album\">A Blessing And A Curse</a>. During the next year, Neff began touring with the band as an unofficial sixth member.\n \n On April 5, 2007 Jason Isbell announced that he was no longer a member of the band. The following day, Patterson Hood confirmed the break on the official site. In his letter to the fans, Hood described the parting of ways as &quot;amicable&quot; and expressed the hope that fans would continue to support Drive-By Truckers as well as Jason's solo efforts. In the same letter, Hood announced that John Neff would become a full-time member playing both guitar and pedal steel.\n \n Shortly after Isbell's departure, on April 20, 2007, Patterson Hood announced via the band's website that a longtime friend of The Hood Family, Spooner Oldham, would be joining the band playing keyboard for a string of acoustic performances called The Dirt Underneath Tour.\n \n Drive-By Truckers performed as backup musicians for <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bettye+Lavette\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Bettye Lavette</a>'s 2007 album, The Scene of the Crime.

He greedily and voraciously fills his available time with hiking and wiffle ball games, picnics and other outdoorsy activities that no matter how much any jerk will want to argue with you, are the very elements of the good life. He's a man who probably burns very easily, but he throws himself into nature, even when he's traveling and exploring the rest of America, visiting Missoula on tour and rafting on a river until the sun's well past its setting and the insects have begun their calisthenics and vocal exercises for anyone who wants to watch and listen. He believes in this thing called the good life and in just writing that and thinking about the various things that he values, it's abundantly clear that those are truly aspirations - seeking that old-fashioned good life in the simplest and most assessable of pursuits - from an older time, a generation of hard-working people who didn't feel as if they always needed to be working. It's of a generation of people who worked to afford themselves bread and milk, a roof over their heads and evenings and weekends to get together with their neighbors, close friends and family and enjoy their company anyway they could think of. These pursuits of well-earned rest and relaxation are those that clash violently with the adopted mentality of working overtime all the time so it's really just normal and never being too far removed from a gadget or glowing white screen. There's no moderation to our sad commitment to working and working if only for a more heaping collection of green pieces of paper.\n \n   Kaufman and Floating Action, a band that has gotten tighter and tighter over the last two years and turned into a soul-grooving group that wouldn't have been out of its league in Muscle Shoals, Memphis, Philadelphia or Detroit in the 60s and 70s, bring us to a very calm place where they woo us with gorgeous melodies and scrappily fuzzed out tones that radiate a vinyl warmth that somehow immediately instills a feeling of nostalgic happiness. \n \n  The songs that are on the band's self-titled debut full-length are numbers that reflect the carefree, I'm-clocking-out-early-for-the-rest-of-the-day thought even if there's a love problem or an even more torturous non-love problem. Mostly, the songs that Kaufman writes come from a spot of reluctant comfort, where a man and a woman are in the middle of their love, a mutual feeling where they care, love and yearn for the other and they're desperately hoping that it doesn't wane, but who could ever be certain of anything so uncertain as love? Kaufman's characters worry about this constantly - that impermanence of those matters - and there's begging and pleading (all of it mostly internally in the privacy of one's own troubled confidence) that feels absolutely justified and actually quite endearing. It's what we all do in those same situations when the going is good, we pray that something or someone doesn't come along and muck it all up like usual. Kaufman sings about being held up to the sunlight, but he's most wise when we're allowed to drift with him and empathize with his spirit on &quot;So Vapor,&quot; when he lets this line out soft and cool, &quot;When your mind is at ease to let go, to let go, to let go/So vapor.&quot; It captures all of his greatest inspirations and fears in one short and resoundingly soothing touch.\n \n - Words by Sean Moeller\n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/43392347.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/43392347.jpg", "name": "Flow Tribe", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Flow+Tribe", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/34/43392347.jpg", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/85315697.png", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/85315697.png", "name": "Foxygen", "tags": "psychedelic,psychedelic rock,tolisten,psychedelic pop,indie pop", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Foxygen", "bio_summary": "Foxygen is an American indie rock duo originally formed in Westlake Village, California in 2005 by Jonathan Rado and Sam France, &quot;high school kids obsessed with the Brian Jonestown Massacre  After their formation in 2005, the band played wildly experimental music, which featured many influences from 60s psychedelia and avant-garde.

Though his first professional gig was with his father at the age of twelve, he studied classical percussion at Loyola University in New Orleans, and worked as a sideman with straight-ahead combos, funk fusion bands, a Brazilian percussion ensemble (Casa Samba), and even a Celtic group. He introduced percussionist Bill Summers to trumpeter Irvin Mayfield and together they co-founded the wildly successful Los Hombres Calientes.

Gradually the band evolved to its present formation. Neti Vaan on violin joined the band just after Mardi Gras 2002, followed by trumpeter extraordinaire Charlie Fardella in the summer of 2002. Bass saxophonist Tom Saunders, whose extensive knowledge of the traditional jazz repertoire has been honed by years as a DJ at WWOZ, joined the band soon after. The most recent and very welcome addition to the band is Bruce Brackman on clarinet. Lead vocals are handled by Joe, John, Tom and Charlie, and all the members of the band provide backing vocals.\n \n Their most recent CD, Live on Frenchmen Street, won Offbeat Magazine's 2004 Best of the Beat Award for Best Traditional Jazz Album, They were named Best Traditional Jazz Band at the 2005 Big Easy Awards. In 2001 and 2003 they won the Best of the Beat Award for Best Emerging Traditional Jazz Band. The band was voted one of the top three jazz bands in the 2004 reader's poll in Where Y'at Magazine.\n \n Part of the unique sound of the Jazz Vipers comes from the fact that they rarely use any amplification, and they are part of a growing number of bands on Frenchmen Street who trust that the audience will eventually quiet down enough to enjoy the music. When necessary, mikes are used and set-up is minimal. The sound of the band is at the same time retro, full of energy, and unpretentious, with both up-tempo dance numbers and well-chosen ballads; it has been aptly described as neo-trad-jazz.

They reflected these influences in the tapes they recorded and shared with each other, forming the seeds of what would become the Elephant Six Collective. While Robert Schneider became the &quot;popular&quot; face of the collective with the eventual success of The Apples in Stereo, Mangum would ultimately release some of the collective's most interesting and enduringly popular music.\n \n From the ashes of a band called <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Synthetic+Flying+Machine\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Synthetic Flying Machine</a>, Olivia Tremor Control was born, with an original line-up of Will and Bill on guitar and bass and Jeff on drums. Around 1995 Jeff decided to leave the group to focus on his own songs. A year of intensive songwriting (some of it accomplished, according to Jeff, while he was living in a haunted closet!) in Denver, Colorado with Rob Schneider at his <a href=\"http://www.petsounds.co.uk/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pet Sounds</a> studio resulted in his debut album, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Neutral+Milk+Hotel/On+Avery+Island\">On Avery Island</a>, released in 1996, which was mostly Rob and Jeff playing Jeff's songs with a few helpful friends. Jeff eventually expanded the line up of Neutral Milk Hotel and in 1998 released what many consider the band's (and indeed, the Elephant Six Collective's) defining album, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Neutral+Milk+Hotel/In+the+Aeroplane+Over+the+Sea\">In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</a>.\n \n The relative success of the album in addition to the pressures of being suddenly thrust into the spotlight took its toll on Mangum, who disbanded Neutral Milk Hotel in 1998 after a tour in support of their latest album. Jeff has kept out of the public eye since then (although not without rabid fans speculating on his whereabouts), rarely if ever playing acoustic sets and concentrating more on his recorded sound and music collages. Most recently he released a compilation of field recordings of Bulgarian folk music called <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Mangum/Orange+Twin+Field+Works-Volume+1\">Orange Twin Field Works Vol. 1</a> in the summer of 2000, followed by a live album on the <a href=\"http://www.orangetwin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Orange Twin</a> label, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Mangum/Live+at+Jittery+Joe%27s\">Live at Jittery Joe's</a>. The set was recorded in 1997 and was put out to squash the exhorbitant sums that Neutral Milk Hotel live albums were selling for on <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">eBay</a>. The cd features a Quicktime movie of the concert performance, but Mangum is backlit and cannot be seen throughout the video.\n \n On August 2nd, 2005, Jeff Mangum joined Olivia Tremor Control onstage at New York's Bowery Ballroom to sing lead vocals on their songs <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Olivia+Tremor+Control/_/I+Have+Been+Floated\">I Have Been Floated</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Olivia+Tremor+Control/_/Shaving+Spiders\">Shaving Spiders</a>. Accounts say that he was wiping back tears; afterwards, he was pulled to the floor by OTC member Julian Koster and then dogpiled by the rest of the band. He was wearing a baseball cap and a blue button down shirt.\n \n On November 17th, 2005, Jeff Mangum joined <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elf+Power\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Elf Power</a>, another former Elephant Six band, onstage at New York's Knitting Factory for the final chorus of only one song, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Elf+Power/_/The+Arrow+Flies+Close\">The Arrow Flies Close</a>, leaving the stage immediately afterwards.\n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Jeff Snake Greenberg", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Jeff+Snake+Greenberg", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Jenna McSwain", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Jenna+McSwain", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/8387681.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/8387681.jpg", "name": "Jeremy Davenport", "tags": "jazz,club jazz,cool jazz,male jazz vocal,jazz trumpet", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Jeremy+Davenport", "bio_summary": "Jazz Trumpeter Jeremy Davenport was raised in  St. Louis, Mo  and became a merit scholar at the prestigious Manhattan School of music, Davenport also began private study with revered jazz musicians <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Raymond+Mase\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Raymond Mase</a> and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wynton+Marsalis\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Wynton Marsalis</a>.

His themes range from social commentary to personal empowerment,  political satire, and modern love. John Craigie writes, sings, and plays for the people.\n \n The story of John\u2019s first album begins with a new folk singer on the scene in santa cruz, CA with seven years of songwriting pent-up in a 23 year old brain and a 6 year old guitar. In an attempt to put these songs down on disc, john found himself in the middle of the woods, outside of santa cruz, in a one-room studio that also served as a recording studio. With the help of the very eccentric owner of the studio, in about three days, john had laid out over 20 songs. Satisfied with the sound john grabbed the rough mixes and began to pass it around to listeners and fellow musicians. Packaged in a home-made sleeve and case, \u201cI always \u2013ed you\u201d became John\u2019s first album before he got a chance to change anything. It was too late. The response was huge and the demand for the raw sound kept it untouched. Still packaged in the same home-made style, it remains as one of john\u2019s most beloved albums. Like most debut albums, it reflects the innocence and the honesty of a musician\u2019s first step on his/her path.\n \n <a href=\"http://www.johncraigiemusic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.johncraigiemusic.com/</a>\n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/57315563.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/57315563.jpg", "name": "John Fohl", "tags": "blues,acoustic blues,dr. john,seen live", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/John+Fohl", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/34/57315563.jpg", "mbid": "5916c5d6-96c9-41e2-bb69-214431d09305", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "John Lisi & Delta Funk", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lisi+&+Delta+Funk", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "31104881-4cf3-41c8-b793-3492a37e3bba", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/33181569.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/33181569.jpg", "name": "John Rankin", "tags": "guitar,jazz,singer-songwriter,singer/songwriter,standards", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/John+Rankin", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/34/33181569.jpg", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/526022.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/526022.jpg", "name": "Johnny Sketch & The Dirty Notes", "tags": "new orleans,rock,jazz,funk,fusion", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Johnny+Sketch+&+The+Dirty+Notes", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/34/526022.jpg", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/440273.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/440273.jpg", "name": "Jon Cleary", "tags": "blues,funk,jazz,soul,new orleans", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Jon+Cleary", "bio_summary": "A respected session and sideman, British blues pianist and composer Jon Cleary has worked with <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/rock\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">rock</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/blues\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">blues</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/soul\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">soul</a> artists like <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Bonnie+Raitt\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Bonnie Raitt</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/D%27Angelo\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">D'Angelo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Maria+Muldaur\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Maria Muldaur</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taj+Mahal\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Taj Mahal</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eric+Clapton\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Eric Clapton</a>.

The bar's owner offered him a job painting the Maple Leaf's exterior; free admission and beer were Cleary's wages. He soaked up the bar's atmosphere, realizing that blues piano was his calling; the house he lived in had a piano, on which he spent hours practicing each day.\n \n Returning to London culminated in forming a six-piece traditional New Orleans R&amp;B band, with which he developed a reputation as a talented and gentlemanly musician. However, the Big Easy called to Cleary again. He moved back and got bookings in clubs as a featured and side performer, playing with bluesmen like <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Smokey+Johnson\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Smokey Johnson</a>, <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/James+Singleton\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">James Singleton</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/George+Porter\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">George Porter</a>. One of these gigs included <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Walter+%22Wolfman%22+Washington\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Walter &quot;Wolfman&quot; Washington</a> in the audience; taken with Cleary's playing, Washington offered Cleary a spot in his own band. Cleary played with Washington for two years, continuing his introduction to more sophisticated forms of R&amp;B and blues, as well as incorporating Latin influences into his style.\n \n At this point, Cleary began writing his own material and formed his own band, the Absolute Monster Gentlemen, with bassist Cornell Williams and guitarist Derwin &quot;Big D&quot; Perkins from the gospel group the Friendly Travelers, and drummer Jeffrey &quot;Jellybean&quot; Alexander. Just as the Absolute Monster Gentlemen achieved a reputation as one of New Orleans' finest combos, Cleary encountered visa problems and had to return to the U.K. immediately.\n \n Back in England, Cleary continued refining and expanding his vision of the blues, when he received a call from producer John Porter, a fellow Englishman who had seen some of Cleary's performances at the Maple Leaf and wanted to introduce him to the blues scene at large. Recording with Taj Mahal and a gig at the Hollywood Athletic Club followed, as well as a collaboration between Cleary and Porter on his 1999 solo debut album, Moonburn. Three years would go by until a new album would be prepared, but by 2002 he had an eponymous album ready with the Absolute Monster Gentlemen.\n \n See also the page for <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jon+Cleary+and+the+Absolute+Monster+Gentlemen\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Jon Cleary and the Absolute Monster Gentlemen</a>\n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/25407827.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/25407827.jpg", "name": "Jon Spencer Blues Explosion", "tags": "blues,blues rock,garage rock,rock,alternative rock", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Jon+Spencer+Blues+Explosion", "bio_summary": "If you would like to share Jon Spencer Blues Explosion lyrics  with other users of this site, please see the bottom of this page on how to submit Jon Spencer Blues Explosion lyrics.

Website--Jon Spencer Blues Explosion Official Website: <a href=\"http://www.blues-explosion.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.blues-explosion.com</a>.\n \n Combining the dejected airs of the blues with punk's sneering energy, the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion makes records that are often ignored by commercial radio but adored by critics and a hardcore legion of fans alike. Spencer leads his band, together since the early 1990s, into new and innovative musical territories that run the gamut from collaboration with an old-style Mississippi blues artist to incorporating a Theremin. As Melody Maker's John Robb explained, &quot;Spencer is a sharp blade who knows that the feel of rock 'n' roll was far better in the deadly Fifties than in the overrated Sixties.&quot;\n \n Spencer grew up in New Hampshire and went to Brown University, but dropped out his sophomore year after meeting guitarist Julia Cafritz. He had originally wanted to pursue filmmaking, but, &quot;then I realized it would be easier to be onstage and playing music than going through the long, drawn-out hassle of making a movie,&quot; he recalled in a Rolling Stone interview with Christina Kelly. In 1985 he joined New York City-based Pussy Galore with Cafritz; another member was Christina Martinez, who eventually married Spencer. Within a year the band had developed a cult following, though record sales always remained low. &quot;At their '86-'87 peak, Pussy Galore were the finest American punk band going, the jagged side of early Fall/Neubauten filtered through a uniquely U.S. hardcore postgrad sensibility,&quot; wrote Gerard Cosloy in the Village Voice.\n \n Pussy Galore disbanded in 1990, a year after Martinez and Spencer had formed Boss Hog. Spencer busied himself with the new band and another New York City-based outfit called the Honeymoon Killers, and eventually made the acquaintance of drummer Russell Simins. The two began playing together and were later joined by Simins's roommate, guitarist Judah Bauer. The trio officially formed the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion in 1991 and recorded their first effort under this name, Crypt Style, in just five hours, and released it on Crypt Records in 1992. In this band, without a bassist, either Spencer or Bauer will play a rhythm line on their guitar; Spencer is partial to a cheap Japanese-made guitar that his wife bought for fewer than twenty dollars. Eventually the Blues Explosion signed with Caroline and an eponymous debut on the label was released that same year. Joe Levy reviewed it for Rolling Stone, and found that, &quot;at his best, Spencer cross-wires the menacing emptiness of early country blues with the compulsive overload of Nineties noise.&quot; More succinctly, Melody Maker's Cathi Unsworth called it a record &quot;reeking of blood, sex and vicious jazz.&quot;\n \n By 1993 the Blues Explosion had switched to the Matador label, and their second effort, Extra Width, was released that year. Again, they finished in near-record time. On it, wrote Melody Maker's Dave Simpson, they &quot;manage to sound possessed, as if there's actually something in them, throwing this stuff out.&quot; Spencer later said that though he was initially happy with the finished product, when he heard the record played in clubs he discerned its flaws clearly. When it came time to record again--1994's Orange--he took a different approach, and he and Bauer and Simins rehearsed the songs live over a period of weeks. &quot;It used to be that we would go into the studio every three or four months and just record basic tracks in an afternoon,&quot; Spencer said of the previous releases in an interview with Spin's Jac Zinder.\n \n Orange--named in homage to a vivid backdrop behind soul singer James Brown in some 1960s footage they had seen--prompted Spencer to admit to Spin that, &quot;we tried so hard to get the sound full and make a technically superior record to Extra Width that it nearly drove us crazy.&quot; The results were evident. Orange included experimentation with synthesizers and odd production tricks as well as a spoken-word bit that alternative-rapper Beck contributed by phone from Australia. Like other critics, Melody Maker's Robb enthused over Orange, calling it an &quot;unholy, godlike surge of excitement.&quot; Rolling Stone's Jon Wiederhorn called it &quot;an emotional clash of stormy blues, passionate soul and noisy garage rock punctuated at various points by the sounds of lush strings, distorted vocals, DJ scratching and galactic sound effects.&quot;\n \n After touring in support of Orange, the Blues Explosion played some dates with Mississippi blues singer R.L. Burnside. They also appeared on his album, A Ass Pocket Full of Whiskey, and wrote &quot;RL Got Soul&quot; in homage to him for their next project, 1996's Now I Got Worry. Despite this--and its guest appearance by legendary rhythm 'n' blues singer Rufus Thomas--Rolling Stone's Kelly noted, &quot;the album is largely devoid of the black cultural signifiers that have previously worked the nerves of some critics of the Blues Explosion.&quot; She termed Now I Got Worry &quot;darker and even more raucous than...Orange,&quot; and Spencer confirmed that impression in their interview. &quot;There is a lot more personal stuff on the album, just about living, trying to get along,&quot; he said.\n \n After extensive touring and blistering hot live shows, the Blues Explosion had made a name for themselves with garage-rock fans as a band that took chances. Sound-a-like groups began to sprout, but no one could match the Blues Explosion's fever. For the group's next anticipated album, they chose to record the songs live at six different studios. With its handful of various producers, 1998's Acme resulted in mish-mash of sounds. Grit-soul rocker Andre Williams served as executive producer, yet the album highlighted the group's interest in hip-hop and electronic beats. Spencer's wife and their Boss Hog band mate Hollis Queens lent their feminine vocals along with help from members of Delta 72 and The Lonesome Organist. So much came from the many recording sessions that the band decided to release an entire second album full of genre-bending remixes and outtakes. Dubbed Xtra-Acme USA, the disc featured work by electronic musician Moby and remixes with Steve Albini.\n \n Returning to the powerful rock 'n' roll riffs and heavy fuzz of their earlier work, the trio's next album, 2002's Plastic Fang, found the experienced band at their old game. Rolling Stone remarked, &quot;...The band has ditched the noise and come back with a straightforward homage to classic rock and werewolves.&quot; The strength of the commanding &quot;She Said&quot; helped all the tunes swagger and strut with the band's trademarked funky sound. Veteran musicians Dr. John and Funkadelic keyboardist Bernie Worrell added some credibility to what turned out to be the band's last album with Matador Records. The album as a whole sounded more controlled, perhaps in an effort to capitalize on the garage-rock scene that had now infiltrated mainstream media.\n \n 2004 marked a fresh start for the band. Not only did they leave veteran indie label Matador for a new home on Sanctuary Records, they decided to change the band name as well. For their new record Damage, the group would now be known as simply Blues Explosion. &quot;It's always been a band, never a solo project,&quot; Spencer said about dropping his moniker from the band name in an online interview with In Music We Trust. &quot;The name change honors a band that allows the three of us to make music for a while. It may not be the best thing to do. Sometimes we shoot ourselves in the foot. The Blues Explosion is kind of a punk rock band. We do what we want.&quot; That ethos could be heard all over Damage. Public Enemy's Chuck D loaned his talent, as did DJ Shadow, among other eclectic contributors and producers. Critics were split on the album's sound. To some, what once seemed innovative seemed tired; to others it was a reinvigorated group.\n \n Regardless of the guests or producers on each Blues Explosion album, Spencer always makes sure his albums are, over all, dance-worthy. &quot;It's great if you can get some clever intellectual stuff happening,&quot; he told Guitar Player, &quot;but if the song doesn't make you smile and shake your hips, all the clever stuff isn't worth a damn.&quot;\n \n by Carol Brennan and Shannon McCarthy \n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Josh Paxton", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Josh+Paxton", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/256765.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/256765.jpg", "name": "Julia Haltigan", "tags": "folk,female vocalists,under 2000 listeners", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Julia+Haltigan", "bio_summary": "Julia Haltigan is a singer/composer out of New York City.

At the dawn of the twenty-first century, the Lost Bayou Ramblers are the keepers of the flame, champions of Cajun music's cultural past.\n Growing up in Pilette, Louisiana (between Broussard and Lafayette), Louis (fiddle and vocals) and Andre (accordion) Michot were immersed in roots Cajun music from birth, primarily since their father and uncles were already touring the world playing traditional songs as the band Les Freres Michot. After a decade of &quot;initiation&quot; on triangle, guitar, and bass, Andre and Louis felt they were prepared to take on the lead instruments - accordion and violin - and pick up the torch as the next generation in the evolution of their musical heritage.  When the brothers matched up with Chris DeShazo's bass-stomp centered drumming, Alan LeFleur's heavy-thumping upright bass and Cavan Carruth's hard-chocking rhythm guitar, the band began to play their &quot;deep swamp beat&quot; around Acadiana and eventually all over the United States. Since starting out in 1999 they have added dozens of original songs to compliment their vast Cajun repertoire of hundreds of early accordion dancehall tunes, pre-century fiddle tunes, and Cajun swing. It all mixes together to form a definitive sound - capturing the &quot;roots&quot; spirit of their culture's unique music while initiating a renewed cultural identity and pride among their generation. \n The Lost Bayou Ramblers have toured through much of the United States, including performances at the International Country Music Conference in Nashville, the National Folk Festival, the Lowell Folk Festival, the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens' Chile Pepper Fiesta, and the New Orleans Jazz Fest and historic Preservation Hall. The Ramblers have performed internationally in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and their most recent releases, the Grammy Nominated Live:a la Blue Moon (Swallow Records) and Vermilionaire (Bayou Perdu Records) are receiving critical acclaim across North America and Europe.  Whether performing in their native Louisiana or abroad, the Lost Bayou Ramblers passionately embrace their cultural and musical heritage, playing music intimately linked to the agrarian, working class lifestyle. Their music stems from a time before electricity, when the Gulf Coast's incapacitating heat only amplified the backbreaking stresses associated with the toil necessary to sustain a successful farm. Indeed, south Louisiana's work ethic was the natural force that ground through the Cajun ego, liberating in song the fervor and spirit of a people. The Lost Bayou Ramblers are like a snapshot of a bygone era. Their music is emotionally raw, intense - in a word, authentically Cajun.\n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Lost In the Middle", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Lost+In+the+Middle", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Lucien Barbarin", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Lucien+Barbarin", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "0f1b7974-d6aa-4d6a-baab-9973b1bf2379", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/25301635.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/25301635.jpg", "name": "Luke Winslow King", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Luke+Winslow+King", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/34/25301635.jpg", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Lyriqs Da Lyraciss", "tags": "hip-hop,new orleans,louisiana", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Lyriqs+Da+Lyraciss", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "c8218a30-e17f-450d-9705-24630fb2b232", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/218381.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/218381.jpg", "name": "M.O.T.O.", "tags": "garage,punk rock,punk,rock,chicago", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/M.O.T.O.", "bio_summary": "MOTO stands for Masters Of The Obvious.

The music is probably best described as energetic, action-packed straight-forward rock n\u00b4roll with influences from both metal, hard rock and punk.\n \n After some booze-ridden recording sessions the debute album 'Mainline' was released 2003 and received quite approving comments by the critics and the fans. Since then Mainline has played a number of kick-ass gigs and is currently working on pre-production of their second album. The new single 'Devil made me do it/Let it bleed' was released February 2007 and it shows a darker, heavier and rougher side of the band.\n \n Band members are:\n Wacky-T - Vocals and guitars\n Johnny Bombers - Drums\n Uncle Sam - Bass\n \n <a href=\"http://www.mainline.fi\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mainline.fi</a>\n <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/mainlineofficial\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.myspace.com/mainlineofficial</a>\n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Major Bacon", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Major+Bacon", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "a4931e10-b263-4022-803b-c743a8d657d6", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Marc Stone", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Marc+Stone", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Marcello Benetti", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Marcello+Benetti", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Mark & The Pentones", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Mark+&+The+Pentones", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Mark Barrett", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Mark+Barrett", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "cd6176f4-4889-4770-a325-d4cee651fea5", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Mark Braud", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Mark+Braud", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "3145ea71-818d-498f-bc86-9e945915f3d6", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Mark Penton", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Mark+Penton", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Meghan Stewart", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Meghan+Stewart", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Meschiya Lake & The Little Big Horns", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Meschiya+Lake+&+The+Little+Big+Horns", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Meschiya Lake & Tom McDermott", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Meschiya+Lake+&+Tom+McDermott", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Meta the Man", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Meta+the+Man", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/11290717.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/11290717.jpg", "name": "Mice Parade", "tags": "post-rock,electronic,experimental,indie,electronica", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Mice+Parade", "bio_summary": "Mice Parade is the nom-de-son of <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Adam+Pierce\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Adam Pierce</a>, &quot;Mice Parade&quot; being an anagram of Pierce's name.

In it, she weaves stories of nature overtaking crumbling city structures (&quot;When Autumn Came&quot;), of dancing like you caught the spirit of a swamp thing (&quot;Swamp Foot&quot;), of weary French Quarter hustlers (&quot;Your Way&quot;), of Bourbon Street's true face, behind the scenes (&quot;Bourbon Street Blues&quot;), of witnessing young girls come of age and learn the city's lessons and limits the hard way (&quot;Bayou Black&quot;), and of tarot card readings come true (&quot;Fortune Teller&quot;).\n  \n The album's dynamic brass-laden basslines and rhythms unfold influence from rich histories of the south's deep musical roots. These songs are a thank-you to the community that contributed so much to the artist's life, musically, and otherwise.\n \n  \n SOUND\n The sound of Nasimiyu's music is comprised of organic instrumentation -- upright bass, guitar, piano, baritone saxophone, and drums, layered with soulful, spunky vocals. The feel is a little vintage, drawing influence from jazz, blues, and motown classics. Meanwhile, it is forward-thinking in its composition, which is innovative and occasionally experimental.\n \n  \n  INFLUENCES\n Billie Holiday, Michael Jackson, Outkast, Stevie Wonder, Janelle Monae, Fiona Apple, James Brown, Regina Spektor, Amy Winehouse, Bill Withers, Lauryn Hill, Louis Armstrong, Glen David Andrews, TV on the Radio, Freddie Mercury, Claude Debussy, New Orleans Secondlines, sweating, reverence, nature, astronomy, mushrooms, film noir, marching bands, flirtatiousness, voodoo, burlesque, Dia de los Muertos, birds, dance, Africa, heartache, metamorphosis, surrealism, anthropology, and elephant ear plants.\n \n  \n BIO\n Nasimiyu Murumba is a vocalist, composer, dancer, performer currently living in New Orleans.\n A self-taught musician, she applies her many talents in writing, composing, arranging, and performing all of her own original material. She has pulled from many experiences throughout her life, loves, and travels to develop the original sound she evokes in her music.\n Nasimiyu started singing and dancing as a baby and has continued to pursue that passion into adulthood. At 23, she feels honored to be able to perform and play music professionally.\n Nasimiyu graduated from Creative Arts High School in her hometown of Saint Paul, Minnesota, where she immersed herself in the study of dance, theater, poetry, photography, and film. In her spare time she taught herself to play piano and guitar, and began songwriting at an early age.\n The Twin Cities provided her with many artistic opportunities, including collaborating with many hip hop artists, teaching dance classes, incorporating the arts into many community organizing projects, putting together large-scale concerts, acting in independent films, modeling, and building 3 years of wonderful experiences as a burlesque performer.\n She went to New Orleans in the summer of 2009 with the intention of visiting for a week, with hopes to learn a bit about its musical and cultural roots. However, she quickly fell in love with the city and has been there ever since, with continued piety in exploring the region's rich history and heritage. As she puts it, &quot;To this day, simply living and breathing in the city of New Orleans is the best music education I've ever had.&quot; \n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/75527406.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/75527406.jpg", "name": "Natalie Mae", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Natalie+Mae", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/34/75527406.jpg", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/24556521.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/24556521.jpg", "name": "Native America", "tags": "bedroom pop,tropical,indie,chinquapin records", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Native+America", "bio_summary": "Native America is the name of more than one artist  1) a bedroom pop project started in New Orleans by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ross+Farbe\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Ross Farbe</a>.\n 2) A hardcore rap group from Millbrae, CA.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+ARP\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">DJ ARP</a>, <span title=\"Unknown artist\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">MC birkle</span>, and <span title=\"Unknown artist\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">MC Selina</span>", "image_small": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/34/24556521.jpg", "mbid": "08aa2ba7-9f8f-4380-a519-adf216b0355c", "bio_content": "Native America is the name of more than one artist\n \n 1) a bedroom pop project started in New Orleans by <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ross+Farbe\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">Ross Farbe</a>.\n 2) A hardcore rap group from Millbrae, CA.  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/DJ+ARP\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">DJ ARP</a>, <span title=\"Unknown artist\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">MC birkle</span>, and <span title=\"Unknown artist\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">MC Selina</span>\n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Nattie", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Nattie", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Naughty Professor", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Naughty+Professor", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Nervous Duane", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Nervous+Duane", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Neslort", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Neslort", "bio_summary": "Neslort is the brainchild and muse of one of New Orleans\u2019 most versatile musicians: trombonist and composer Rick Trolsen.

After moving to New Orleans in 1989, Rick\u2019s talents quickly established him as a popular sideman comfortable with every style of jazz, blues and rock. All of this, along with some of New Orleans finest players, was poured into the original incarnation of Neslort. By the mid-90s, the band had a well-received run through 3 consecutive years at the prestigious New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and also found time for several recordings. After his journey took him to Colorado for mountain air and sunshine, New Orleans called Trolsen back. But even as he toured with stand-out brass bands such as the Nightcrawlers and Bonerama, and expanded his repertoire to embrace Brazilian choro among other trends, Trolsen was always composing and readying for the return of Neslort.

The most unlikely of comrades, NRF combines the best of hip-hop, rock, and soul to create a genre contagiously New Orleans, a flavor that has fans coming back for more.\n \n The band, which is led by J Remy and also features the likes of Dustin Cole (guitar), Gregory Cavalier (drums), Kevin Burr (bass), and Stephen Rhodes (keys), has defied the odds, much like most of South Louisiana and Mississippi, to not only garner the attention of their peers, but earn their respect as well.\n \n NRF broke records and turned heads when they became the first independent band to climb the charts to reach #1 on Radio U, a popular radio station covering most of the Northeastern and Midwestern United States, beating out Grammy-award winning artists such as Lifehouse, Switchfoot and Relient K.\n \n \u201cIt\u2019s so much more than a band,\u201d explains J Remy as he glances over the iron balcony that rests ever so discreetly above the corner of Iberville and Bourbon Street. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to simply make music, we want to change the way people experience music.\u201d Drummer, Greg Cavalier agrees. \u201cYou should not just hear music, you should feel it. We want people to walk away from our shows not only hearing what we say but feeling the raw emotion behind each lyric.\u201d\n \n As the fans file out of the club and into the cold night air, drained of energy and drenched in sweat, keyboardist Stephen Rhodes knows they felt it. \u201cIt was a good night. They were right there with us the whole time.\u201d\n \n \u201cUnbelievable\u201d comments Kayla, a 22-year old college student from Tulane University. \u201cIt\u2019s a release.

The results of his collaboration with artists such as Marcus Johnson, Mike Phillips, Phillip Martin, Jackiem Joyner, Marion Meadows, David Dyson, Maysa and Kim Waters are nothing less than spectacular. \n \n Like so many artists destined for greatness, Patrick's taste for jazz started early. While growing up in Portland, Oregon he was exposed to the sounds of George Duke, The Crusaders and a myriad of other great jazz artists. He grew up in the church and was fascinated by the harmonies, voicing and colors created by the organist and the pianist. \n \n \u201cIt was amazing to me how they were able to blend sounds and to work magic with the keys, \u201cCooper said. \u201cI knew then that music would be a big part of my life.\u201d He purchased books to teach himself to read music and jazz theory. By age 18, this jazz aficionado was the church's main organist and keyboardist. \n By age 21, Patrick co-founded a contemporary jazz band called N-Touch. The band afforded Patrick the opportunity to hone and showcase his songwriting skills. The band performed at various jazz clubs and festivals. The band quickly achieved tremendous notoriety and fame in the Portland area. In 2000, Cooper relocated to Washington, DC where he has truly continued to flourish on the world jazz scene. \n \n \n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Paul Longstreth", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Longstreth", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/3233375.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/3233375.jpg", "name": "Paul Sanchez", "tags": "under 2000 listeners,new orleans,singer-songwriter", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Sanchez", "bio_summary": "After 16 years with the popular rock band Cowboy Mouth, Paul Sanchez has stepped out on his own.

To date those shows have been witnessed by more than 8 million people and described best by Cake magazine when it noted: &quot;...on a bad night they\u2019ll tear the roof off the joint and on a good night they\u2019ll save your soul.&quot; Now he embarks on a solo career, spinning his tales and singing his songs from the heart on new CDs, and in clubs and living rooms across America.\n \n Paul writes songs the way your grandmother might have crafted quilts, painstakingly sewing the pieces together to form a blanket that will keep you warm when it's time to rest your head.

He's lived a thousand lives, but he wakes up everyday with the wide eyes of a new born babe.\n  \n Paul has a skewed vision of the world that comes only with an existence based in New Orleans, a city rampant with celebration and despair. It's beyond colloquialisms and language. It's more of a slant and feel. It's in the words he loves, and the friends he writes. It's in the pain of having known a welfare Christmas, the joy of having known a welfare Christmas, and the joy of having toasted fine wine from a grand European chateau. Cut him, it's in his blood.\n  \n Paul's songs have appeared in The Accused starring Jodie Foster, Homicide: Life On the Streets, The Underneath, by Steven Soderbergh, and on CMT&quot;s Travel America series.

Paul was also Music Supervisor for, and appeared in, the independent film, At Last, starring Martin Donovan and Kelly Lynch. (to be released in 2007). His song, At The Foot of Canal Street, appears on the critically acclaimed Shout Factory New Orleans musical history boxed set, &quot;Doctors, Professors, Kings and Queens, a Big Ole Box Of New Orleans. Co-written in 1999 with New Orleans legend and dear friend, John Boutte, the song eerily foreshadows the aftermath of the flood that was to come.\n \n He has been busy since leaving Cowboy Mouth. His CD, Between Friends (his 7th solo release) was, released in November 2006. It features 13 songs written by Paul and performed by his friends, including John Boutte, Susan Cowsill, Darius Rucker, Jim Sonifeld, Theresa Andersson and many others.

Special guests on the CD include Ivan Neville, Raymond Weber (New Orleans Social Club, Dumpstaphunk),Craig Klein (Bonerama, Harry Connick Jr), Shamarr Allen, James Andrews, Big Sam (Big Sam\u2019s Funky Nation) David Torkanowsky and former Cowboy Mouth members Sonia Tetlow and Mary LaSang.

This story begins on the steps of the Savannah Civic Center, where Brock Butler met Adam Perry after freshman orientation at the Savannah College of Art &amp; Design. A few yards away was their dormitory, The Oglethorpe House. This would be the site of their first jams together and many late night sessions with the other band members.\n \n Adam &amp; Brock immediately hit it off and soon began the search for the other pieces needed to form some sort of workable band. Joe Stickney and Brett Hinton were added to the collective shortly thereafter on drums and keys, respectively. Soon after,  everyone began taking the first steps to writing music together. The four friends would spend their freshman year in school seeking out the sounds of Perpetual Groove in their dorm rooms, much to the dismay of their neighbors.\n \n After spending their first year in the dormitory, Brock, Adam, Brett, and Joe decided to move out of the city and out to Tybee beach, offering not just a change in locale, but also more space and privacy to develop the band. In what would later be referred to as The Elephant House days, the quartet took the first steps together in documenting the Perpetual Groove sound as it was born, putting together their first official recording. This demo would become known as the &quot;Jungle Funk Demo.&quot; Among the compositions included on this tape were Simple Pleasure Man, Echo, Funk Kitchen, Sitting In The Ghetto, Mota, Nocean, and The March of Gibbles Army. This tape offers the earliest known recordings of the Perpetual Groove sound.\n \n The band did some very light touring through 1999, with stops at the original Wherehouse in Charleston, SC, The Music Farm, and The Brandyhouse in Atlanta. Their real home however, was J.J. Cagney's, the local bar for their friends and one of the only places in Savannah to feature live music all week. Touring was made difficult by everyone's commitment to school and part time jobs, so playing locally was an easy way to make a little money and hone their skills.\n \n Brock and Adam were both minors in sound engineering at The Savannah College of Art &amp; Design when they decided to utilize the school's studios and equipment to record the very first Perpetual Groove studio album. This album which is simply called Perpetual Groove featured eight tracks, all of which are still in rotation today except for two, &quot;Galaxy Soup&quot; &amp; &quot;Dionysus.&quot; Only five hundred copies of the album were pressed and it quickly sold out in Savannah and Charleston.\n \n Unfortunately, by this time, graduation was looming and the band found they were facing an uncertain future, with careers calling outside of Savannah. Joe and Brett both left the band to pursue other roads of employment, leaving Adam and Brock behind in Savannah. This left Perpetual Groove only half complete and more to the point, dead in the water.\n \n In the period following the dissolve of the original line-up, Brock and Adam set out to continue making music together. Sharing a house on Wilmington Island, the two musicians spent time writing, playing, and putting together ideas for new projects. Both hosted the open mic night at J.J. Cagney's every Tuesday with a few other local musicians as a way to help pay the bills and get a chance to jam with other musicians. Brock also began a long stint of Sunday nights at The Mellow Mushroom, developing his solo act while still performing original Perpetual Groove material.\n \n It's 2001 and Brock Butler and Adam Perry are working through their summer with various jobs, including hosting the open mic night at local music shack, J.J. Cagney's. It was at one of these open mic nights that Brock and Adam met their future band mates, Albert Suttle and Matt McDonald. The pair took the stage together for the first time in the early months of the summer, and it quickly became a regular occurrence on open mic night to see Matt and Albert jamming alongside Adam and Brock.\n \n The quartet was asked by the owner of Cagney's to play a special Grateful Dead Tribute Show on the anniversary of Jerry Garcia's passing. Realizing the potential, the quartet began playing more and more together, searching out the sounds that would become Perpetual Groove as you know them today. By the time August rolled around, the four individuals stood together as a band for the first time.\n \n Due to employment obligations with United States Army, Albert and Matt were both limited to a light/local touring schedule for the fall of 2001, and when 9/11 occurred, it changed their touring outlook drastically. Throughout the fall it was not uncommon for one or the other to have to report for duty in the wee hours of the morning immediately following a show. It was also along this time that the band befriended future manager, Ben Ferguson. Ben quickly sold the band on his long-term vision of the future and things began to take a serious turn.\n \n It was during the early months of 2002 that the band really started to develop their sound and stage presence as a whole. Tim Fallin, who was running sound for the band, was joined by Ben's longtime friend Jason Huffer, and slowly the makings of a crew was apparent. The percussion team started to really connect and Brock and Matt both found comfortable realms for the noises they were creating. New material was slowly creeping into the setlists, written together for the first time. Each member continued to evolve their sounds as new gear was tried, purchased, and then traded again, until the right tones came together.\n \n A lot of important advances were made during the winter months of 01 and 02. The band made their first foray into Atlanta in December and quickly befriended local scenesters C. Robie and The Dunhams. It was through The Dunhams that the band really started to build a strong Atlanta following, which was highlighted early on by their appearance at The Annual Music Midtown Fest. The music was starting to roll and it was time to get the other aspects of the band into motion, namely promotions.\n \n It was decided early on that the best way to get the name out without an album was to hand out free live CDs. The marketing approach worked and the band started seeing more and more people coming out to their shows. Still touring lightly, the band decided it was time to start looking for another piece of the big puzzle, a booking agency. We were introduced to Degy Booking and Chad Denney through our friends The Dunhams. Everyone instantly hit it off with Chad and starting working with Degy exclusively in the fall of 2002. Making their way into the world of full time touring....\n \n One year after forming, Perpetual Groove was taking the steps to becoming a full time touring band. Chad and Ben had put together an aggressive touring schedule and plan, focusing largely on building the Southeast fanbase. The band gigged regularly from at least Thursday through Saturday for the better part of the fall picking up more and more fans in each new market they performed. However, one thing was still missing, an album.\n Through some Atlanta friends, the members of Perpetual Groove had befriended Mark Michaelson, the owner of a local studio. It was at his studio that the band decided to record their first album together, Sweet Oblivious Antidote. Although the album was recorded in July, it would not be released for another six months.\n \n In September of 2002, the band made their first appearance at the Georgia Harvest Festival, with an early main stage slot and an evening slot on a mud-ridden second stage. It would mark the first real festival appearance for the band as well as the first true gathering of what was slowly becoming a solid fanbase. However, the real moment came on Saturday night with the help of Jeff Dunham who put together a late night performance for Perpetual Groove which won critical acclaim and allowed the band to truly showcase their unique style of jam. This performance helped solidify Perpetual Groove as a band to be reckoned with in the Southeast. With Harvest Fest behind them, Perpetual Groove embarked on their first ever tour outside the Southeast, heading up to the Midwest for a short two week tour. The band closed out 2002 with a sold out performance at The Georgia Theatre on New Year's Eve with good friends Moonshine Still.\n \n As 2003 turned, the band gigged harder then ever before, playing sometimes almost five days a week in support of their new album, which was released in late January. Though mostly performing in the Southeast, they were presented with the opportunity of supporting The Big Wu on their Spring Northeast tour. It would be their first time in the area, as well as a return trip to the Midwest. The band continued to grow as did their fanbase, and by the time summer came around, they were ready to expand their territory even more.\n \n The band's first National tour would begin in June of 2003, with two grueling months on the road, numerous festival plays, including their first High Sierra and Berkfest appearances and tour stops from California all the way to New York. In just a little under a year, the band had managed to log almost 70,000 miles on their new van. Summer turned to Fall and in the blink of an eye, 2003 was almost gone. The end of the year was commemorated by their first appearance at the Historic Lucas Theatre in Savannah, GA for their New Year's Eve show.\n \n Of course, this story has no end in sight, and as 2004 moves along, the band is still at it, cultivating a national fanbase and refining their craft. A few tweaks here, some changes there, and you have the band has they exist today.

Chained To The Chariot follows three previous albums: Quitters EP in 2004, Long After the Thrill in 2003, and their self-titled debut in 2001. They've emerged from Katrina fully formed with the addition of more drums, bass, keyboards and trumpet giving their fuzz-guitar and pedal-steel-driven sound an extra dose of texture.

In 2007, the band completed their inaugural trip to the West Coast, which featured several memorable shows, including a sold out performance at the famed - and now closed - Sweetwater Saloon in Mill Valley, CA.

Right now, in 2012, there\u2019s something in the air, as The Royal Southern Brotherhood drag their thrilling new brand of blues-rock and white-hot musicianship from the Southern States onto the world stage.

The band is led by Arleigh Kincheloe (Sister Sparrow), whose astoundingly powerful voice and sly demeanor make for a spellbinding presence onstage.

While each...  of the Birds are capable of lighting up the stage with jaw-dropping displays of musicianship, it's clear they're focused on delivering the band's infectious music as a single entity. Simply put, the band's live show is explosive.\n \n Dynamic singer and front-woman Sister Sparrow first began penning tunes in the alleyways and back roads between New York City and the Catskill Mountains as a teenager. Though already aided and abetted by her harmonica-shredding brother Jackson, it was clear that a large, powerful band was needed to do justice to the songs she was crafting. The brother and sister team called upon their cousin Bram, a California-bred drummer of considerable prowess, to help them assemble a super-band of epic proportions. Bram brought in childhood friends JJ Byars (alto saxophone) and Ryan Snow (trombone), and Ryan called upon baritone saxophonist and close friend Johnny Butler. Later, the addition of trumpeter Phil Rodriguez completed the unstoppable force of the virtuosic Dirty Birds' horns. The rhythm section was filled out by tapping guitarist Sasha Brown and bassist Aidan Carroll, a tandem that proved to be the perfect engineers of the hard-driving, bare-knuckle grooves that propel this ferocious group.\n \n It was evident from the start that the deep friendships among its members translated directly to the music they made together. While Sister Sparrow is the principal songwriter and unifying voice of the band, the Dirty Birds work collaboratively on arrangements. The result is musical creativity and diversity seldom seen in groups of this size and character. By the middle of 2009, Sister Sparrow &amp; The Dirty Birds had packed New York's legendary Rockwood Music Hall every Saturday night, holding down a five-month-long residency that built them a reputation for being one of the funkiest, tightest groups in the city. Fueled by the band's boundless energy, every show turned into a wild dance party, and the Dirty Birds established a rabid following of fans eager to receive a potent dose of good times, delivered by the band night after night.\n \n Within six months of their November 2010 debut release on Modern Vintage Recordings, Sister Sparrow &amp; The Dirty Birds had opened for the Black Keys, the Neville Brothers, Dr. John, the Rebirth Brass Band, and the Soul Rebels Brass Band, among others. Through appearances at such festivals as moe.down, Strange Creek, Camp Jam, Sterling Stage, and late-night at New Orleans JazzFest, they continued to gain wider acclaim. In the spring of 2011, they embarked on an extensive national tour that continues through year\u2019s end and includes performances at Gathering of the Vibes and Bear Creek.\n \n Sister Sparrow's commanding stage presence alone is more than enough to dazzle audiences, but the magic doesn't end with her: the band's palpable camaraderie, undeniable talent and passion for music makes for a contagious combination that is taking the country by storm. Sister Sparrow &amp; The Dirty Birds' blend of seductive soul and dirty blues-rock reminds audiences why they love live music.\n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/28683803.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/28683803.jpg", "name": "Slangston Hughes", "tags": "toronto,canadian hip hop,crooked halo collective,seen live", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Slangston+Hughes", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/34/28683803.jpg", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Smokin' Time Jazz Club", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Smokin%27+Time+Jazz+Club", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/3929207.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/3929207.jpg", "name": "Sofia Talvik", "tags": "female vocalists,swedish,singer-songwriter,folk,acoustic", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Sofia+Talvik", "bio_summary": "Sofia Talvik is a Swedish singer/songwriter. \n Sofia Talvik was born on an island just off the west coast of Sweden.

They began rocking some of New Orleans\u2019 most beloved live music venues. A chance gig opening for the Neville Brothers got them a real start\u2014and an official name. It was youngest brother Cyril Neville who first called them \u201cSoul Rebels,\u201d a good name for a band that strived to incite positive change in its treasured musical heritage.\n \n Since those days, the band has settled on an eight\u2010piece lineup, building a career around an eclectic live show that harnesses the power of horns and drums in the party\u2010like atmosphere of a dance club. Their weekly show at Uptown New Orleans spot Le Bon Temps Roul\u00e9 has been known to descend into a sweaty shout\u2010along as the band mixes up songs from its five studio albums with hits by Jay\u2010Z and OutKast. While touring the U.S., The Soul Rebels have collaborated or shared the stage with notable artists from many corners of the rock, pop and jazz worlds, including Metallica, Kanye West, Snoop Dogg, Cee Lo Green, Arcade Fire, The Roots, Bootsy Collins, Seal, Robert Plant &amp; Jimmy Page, Counting Crows, Green Day, Drive By Truckers, James Brown, Roy Hargrove, Allen Toussaint, Galactic, Slick Rick, Chuck Brown, Terence Blanchard, The Gap Band, Better than Ezra and many more. Averaging around 250 shows per year, the Soul Rebels have brought the party to stages as far away as South Africa and Europe, playing some of the world\u2019s best\u2010known music events, including, Bonnaroo, Electric Forest, Umbria Jazz Fest, Antibes Jazz Festival, Montreal Jazz festival, the Wanee Festival and, of course, the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.\n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/5010955.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/5010955.jpg", "name": "Southern Whiskey Rebellion", "tags": "southern metal,stoner rock,sludge,nola,metal", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Southern+Whiskey+Rebellion", "bio_summary": "Southern Whiskey Rebellion has been pounding the southern metal scene with LOUD guitars and a plethera of whiskey shots for almost a decade.

Here's a little about Star &amp; Micey's somewhat accidental beginnings.\n \n It was a dark night, like many before it in Memphis. Joshua Cosby walked home from rehearsal with his guitar slung over his back. A local homeless man flagged him down, not for money but for a story. The man explained how he had written a song about his ex-wife Micey and there, on that dimly lit street occurred an exchange, two men playing each other songs of heartbreak and the ultimate sacrifice. Upon parting ways, the displaced man revealed his name to be Star. That name became the fixture for one of Memphis\u2019s most inventive bands: Star &amp; Micey. The original duo are listed as two brothers without the same last name, Geoff Smith and Joshua Cosby. It was merely coincidence that the two later met Nick Redmond at a local pub and began a relationship based on music and above all, brotherhood.\n \n Star &amp; Micey's self-titled debut album, released in October 2009, featured a revolving door of notable musicians that included Luther Dickinson (The Black Crowes, North Mississippi Allstars), Jody Stephens (Big Star) and Rick Steff (Cat Power, Lucero). In contrast, I Can't Wait showcases the band's return to the musical potency of its three core members. Because when the sun sets, it is Cosby, Smith and Redmond who will be walking home from rehearsal or driving to the next gig. Flag 'em down for a story, they will probably share a few songs too.\n \n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/43450905.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/43450905.jpg", "name": "Stefan", "tags": "national-folk,techno,germany,acoustic guitar,rac", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Stefan", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/34/43450905.jpg", "mbid": "1c51ff9e-c6f0-418b-b39e-e225bff2117e", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/39362753.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/39362753.jpg", "name": "Stephanie Nilles", "tags": "female vocalists,singer-songwriter,indie,female jazz vocalists,jazz", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Stephanie+Nilles", "bio_summary": "Stephanie Nilles is an independent musician constantly on the move.

The seeds for the band were planted in another Chicago band during the late '60s, the Tradewinds, which featured brothers Chuck and John Panozzo (who played bass and drums, respectively), as well as acquaintance Dennis DeYoung (vocals, keyboards). By the dawn of the '70s, the group had changed its name to TW4, and welcomed aboard a pair of guitarists/vocalists, James &quot;JY&quot; Young and John Curulewski -- securing a recording contract in 1972 with Wooden Nickel Records (a subsidiary of RCA). Soon after, the group opted to change its name once more, this time to Styx, named after a river from Greek mythology that ran through &quot;the land of the dead&quot; in the underworld. \n \n Early on, Styx's music reflected such then-current prog rockers as Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer and the Moody Blues, as evidenced by such releases as 1972's self-titled debut, 1973's Styx II, 1974's The Serpent Is Rising, and 1975's Man of Miracles. While the albums (as well as nonstop touring) helped the group build a substantial following locally, Styx failed to break through to the mainstream, until the track &quot;Lady,&quot; originally from their second album, started to get substantial airplay in late 1974 on Chicago radio station WLS-FM. The song was soon issued as a single nationwide, and quickly shot to number six on the singles chart, as Styx II was certified gold. By this time, however, the group had grown disenchanted with its record label, and opted to sign on with A&amp;M for their fifth release overall, 1975's Equinox (the band's former label would issue countless compilations over the years, culled from tracks off their early releases). On the eve of the tour in support of the album, Curulewski abruptly left the band, and was replaced by Tommy Shaw (sadly, Curulewski would pass away from an aneurysm in 1988). Shaw proved to be the missing piece of the puzzle for Styx, as most of their subsequent releases throughout the late '70s earned at least platinum certification (1976's Crystal Ball, 1977's The Grand Illusion, 1978's Pieces of Eight, and 1979's Cornerstone), and spawned such hit singles and classic rock radio standards as &quot;Come Sail Away,&quot; &quot;Renegade,&quot; &quot;Blue Collar Man,&quot; &quot;Fooling Yourself,&quot; and the power ballad &quot;Babe.&quot; \n \n Despite the enormous success of &quot;Babe,&quot; it caused tension within the group -- specifically between Shaw and DeYoung (the latter of whom was the song's author), as the guitarist wanted Styx to continue in a more hard rock-based direction, while DeYoung sought to pursue more melodic and theatrically based works. This led to DeYoung's brief ouster from the group (although it was kept completely hush-hush at the time), before a reconciliation occurred. The bandmembers decided that their first release of the '80s would be a concept album, 1981's Paradise Theater, which was loosely based on the rise and fall of a once beautiful theater (which was supposedly used as a metaphor for the state of the U.S. at the time -- the Iranian hostage situation, the Cold War, Reagan, etc.). Paradise Theater became Styx's biggest hit of their career (selling over three million copies in a three-year period), as they became one of the U.S. top rock acts due to such big hit singles as &quot;Too Much Time on My Hands&quot; and &quot;The Best of Times.&quot; But the behind-the-scenes bickering only intensified in the wake of the album's success, as DeYoung was now convinced that a more theatrical approach was the future direction for Styx. Shaw and the rest of the group begrudgingly went along, and while the resulting follow-up was another hit, 1983's sci-fi-based Kilroy Was Here (which told the story of a future where rock &amp; roll was outlawed, almost a carbon copy of the story line of Rush's 2112), the album would eventually lead to the group's breakup -- as the ensuing prop-heavy tour seemed to focus more on scripted dialogue and lengthy films than good old rock &amp; roll. \n \n A forgettable live album, Caught in the Act, was issued in 1984, before Styx went on hiatus, and the majority of the bandmembers pursued solo projects throughout the remainder of the decade. DeYoung issued 1984's Desert Moon (which spawned a moderate hit single with its reflective title track), 1986's Back to the World, and 1988's Boomchild, Young released 1986's City Slicker, while Shaw put forth several solo sets -- 1984's Girls with Guns, 1985's What If?, 1986's Live in Japan, and 1987's Ambition. Shaw then formed Damn Yankees along with former Night Ranger bassist/singer Jack Blades, guitarist Ted Nugent, and drummer Michael Cartellone, a group that enjoyed commercial success right off the bat with its self-titled debut in 1990 (due to the hit power ballad &quot;High Enough&quot;), before issuing an unsuccessful sophomore effort two years later, Don't Tread. During Shaw's tenure with Damn Yankees, Styx had re-formed with newcomer Glen Burtnik taking the place of Shaw -- issuing a new studio album in 1990, Edge of the Century, which spawned yet another hit power ballad, &quot;Show Me the Way.&quot; But the Styx reunion was a fleeting one, as the group's members went their separate ways shortly thereafter -- with DeYoung going on to play Pontius Pilate in a revival of Jesus Christ Superstar (and issuing an album of Broadway show tunes, 1994's 10 on Broadway), while Young issued a pair of solo discs (1994's Out on a Day Pass and 1995's Raised by Wolves), and Shaw teamed up with Jack Blades for the short-lived outfit Shaw Blades (issuing a lone recording in 1995, Hallucination). \n \n A re-recording of their early hit &quot;Lady&quot; (titled &quot;Lady '95&quot;) for a Greatest Hits compilation finally united Shaw with his former Styx bandmates, which led to a full-on reunion tour in 1996. But drummer John Panozzo fell seriously ill at the time (due to a long struggle with alcoholism), which prevented him from joining the proceedings -- and he passed away in July of the same year. Although grief-stricken, Styx persevered with new drummer Todd Sucherman taking the place of Panozzo, as the Styx reunion tour became a surprise sold-out success, resulting in the release of a live album/video, 1997's Return to Paradise, while a whole new generation of rock fans was introduced to the grandiose sounds of Styx via a humorous car ad which used the track &quot;Mr. Roboto,&quot; as well as songs used in such TV shows as South Park and Freaks &amp; Geeks. The group even stuck around long enough to issue a new studio album, 1999's Brave New World, before friction within the band set in once again. \n \n With the other Styx members wanting to soldier on with further albums and tours, DeYoung was forced to take a break when he developed an uncommon viral ailment, which made the singer extremely sensitive to light. DeYoung was able to eventually overcome his disorder, but not before Shaw and Young opted to enlist new singer Lawrence Gowan and issued a pair of live releases in the early 21st century -- 2000's Arch Allies: Live at Riverport (split 50-50 between Styx and REO Speedwagon) and 2001's Styx World: Live 2001. DeYoung began touring as a solo artist at the same time, and eventually attempted to sue Shaw and Young over the use of the name Styx (the lawsuit was eventually settled in late 2001). Around the same time, Chuck Panozzo confirmed rumors that he had contracted AIDS (but was battling the virus successfully), while the turbulent career of Styx was told in an entertaining episode of VH1's Behind the Music. \n \n In the spring of 2003, a new studio album featuring Gowan arrived in stores. For Cyclorama, Styx consisted of Shaw, Young, Burtnik, Sucherman, and Gowan. The album also featured guest appearances from John Waite, Brian Wilson, and actor Billy Bob Thornton. By the end of the year, Burtnik was out of the band and replaced by former Bad English and Babys member Ricky Phillips, although Panozzo did play with the group on selected live dates. The two-CD Come Sail Away: The Styx Anthology from 2004 did an excellent job representing the band's career, while 2005's double-disc The Complete Wooden Nickel Recordings collected the band's first four albums. That same year, Styx released the cover version-filled Big Bang Theory, featuring some of their favorite picks from &quot;the Great Rock Songbook.&quot; \n \n \n <strong>Styx</strong> is an American <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/rock\" class=\"bbcode_tag\" rel=\"tag\">rock</a> band, and the first musical act to ever have four consecutive multi-platinum albums.\n \n The group originally formed in the Chicago, Illinois, area in 1961 as &quot;<a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Tradewinds\" class=\"bbcode_artist\">The Tradewinds</a>&quot;. This earliest line-up of the group included vocalist, pianist, keyboardist, and accordion player Dennis DeYoung, and a rhythm section comprising brothers Chuck Panozzo and John Panozzo on bass and drums, respectively. Changing their name briefly to &quot;TW4&quot;, the band added guitarists/vocalists James Young (J.Y.) and John Curulewski. The band members decided to choose a new name when they signed to <span title=\"Unknown label\" class=\"bbcode_unknown\">Wooden Nickel</span> Records; several suggestions were made and, says DeYoung, <strong>Styx</strong> was chosen because it was &quot;the only one that none of us hated.&quot;\n \n Guitarist Tommy Shaw joined the group in 1975 following the departure of Curelewski. Tommy Shaw left in 1983 and returned again in 1995.\n \n Glen Burtnik played guitar, vocals in 90/91 and bass guitar, vocals from 1999 to 2004.\n \n Dennis DeYoung was removed from the band due to a viral ailment that left him sensitive to light in 1999 and was replaced with Lawrence Gowan-Keyboards, Vocals\n \n The present lineup includes new members Todd Sucherman drums, percussion, Lawrence Gowan vocals, keyboards, guitar and Ricky Phillips bass guitar, vocals.\n \n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/42643577.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/42643577.jpg", "name": "Sun Hotel", "tags": "indie,all,hipster garbage,under 2000 listeners,birp", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Sun+Hotel", "bio_summary": "New Orleans-based Sun Hotel have spent the better part of the last two years blazing their own narrative of what it means to be a bona fide rock and roll band \u2013 in an era over-congested with charlatanistic pseudo-artists dead set on making indie gold \u2013 by applying a punk ethic to the familiar sounds of post-gospel.

Eleven years later they played their first gig, having crawled to Brooklyn, NY in the interim. Halfway through the second decade of searching for a drummer, Ryan Sawyer finally assumed the throne.\n \n A near-telepathic nonchalance pervades the music of the Tall Firs. The interwoven melodies of the two guitars converse in a language that has evolved an unsettling familiarity like birdies on a remote island. The drums comment on the discussion, push or pull it, effortlessly gliding from free time to strict metronome and back over the course of a single measure. Melancholic incantations reminiscent of Joni Mitchell or Jackson C. Frank transition into open-tuning workouts of despair and beauty like Mississippi John Hurt throwing down with Wire.\n \n In New York, the band has packed Lower East Side hotspot Tonic, been curated by Jim ORourke to perform at The Stone, and done gigs at dive bars, amphitheatres, and illegal loft spaces while maintaining a semi-residence at Williamsburgs Union Pool. Tall Firs have shared bills with Sonic Youth, Oneida, Awesome Color, Samara Lubelski, P.G. Six, Tim Foljahn, and Corsano/Flaherty amongst other Brooklyn and New England weirdos.\n \n More on the band members: Aaron Mullan (guitar/vox) was a longtime collaborator of now-infamous New Weird American Chris Corsano before spending several years recording albums for other people. Ryan Sawyer (drums/vox) played in At the Drive In as a teenager, and has played in groups such as the Mekons, Fiery Furnaces, and Stars Like Fleas, plus has been a floating presence on the NYC underground jazz scene in groups like Eye Contact; his collaboration with Daniel Carter, Matt Heyner, and Matt Lavelle. Dave Mies (guitar/vox) paid dues in the Baltimore scuzz-rock zone before bringing his world-weary guitar stylings up north.\n \n As a trio, the Tall Firs have the disarming presence of a dog-whisperer, and the unnerving triangular-cold-read of a shadow boxing cr\u00fce of mesmerists.

They also took an early stance against political extremism with their &quot;Oi Against Racism and Political Extremism But Still Against The System&quot; tour.\n \n The Business first emerged off the streets of South London in October 1979, leading a new wave of British punk that was hardly new wave at all. Instead, the Business, along with peers such as Angelic Upstarts, Blitz, and the 4-Skins, came out with a version of punk that was harder and more streetwise than ever, while still maintaining the anthemic qualities of the heavily influential Sham 69. Commonly referred to as Oi! or street-punk, these groups' most obvious brethren comprised the early American hardcore scene. \n \n The Business had a particular knack for churning out anthems, as evidenced by their first single, &quot;Harry May,&quot; and followed by such enduring concert staples as &quot;Drinking and Driving&quot; and &quot;Smash the Discos,&quot; both included on the CD reissue of the classic Suburban Rebels album. The band was on and off again throughout the '80s, but returned for a strong extended stay in 1994 with Keep the Faith. As usual, the disc mixed tales of football and drinking with wry social commentary and working-class singalongs.

Their debut album, Slow Dirty Tears, was released in the U.S. in March 1998. The band lineup for that album included Ida Akesson (keyboards, sampling), Joe Dilworth (drums), John Frenett (bass), Phil Legg (keyboards), and Simon Fisher-Turner (guitar, keyboards). Mary Deigan later replaced Frenett on bass, with Dave Barbarossa joining on drums. They did not release another album and Birch has been focusing on solo projects.\n \n 3) The Hangovers is also a subset of the all-male Cornell University Glee Club, and one of the longest-running a cappella groups at Cornell. Previously, the a cappella group Cayuga\u2019s Waiters had been a subset of the Glee Club, but the \u201cWaiters\u201d disassociated themselves from the more formal vocal ensemble in 1956. Then, a group of Glee Clubbers formed the Sherwoods; but this subset lasted only two years before becoming independent of the Glee Club in 1958.\n \n At this time, a group of fifth-year men - \u201changovers\u201d in Cornell slang - in the Glee Club formed a new a cappella subset, the Hangovers. They remain in more or less constant competition with the Waiters to this day for the honor of most popular a cappella group, with the \u201cHangs\u201d generally viewed as more preppy and the Waiters as bigger partiers. Neither group, however, lacks for dates or aspiring auditioners.\n \n 4) The Hangovers are a german Alternative Rock Band from Emmendingen, near Freiburg.\n \n 5) A  three piece Japanese underground indie alternative pop punk band with a bit of garage they have a big part in the underground Japan scene.\n \n 6) The Hangovers is polish semi acustic band. They are three musicians from Wroc\u0142aw plaing also in another band Nation and The Hangovers is their side project. Their style is created by two acoustic guitars, great vocals, electronics and sound of natural articles.\n More information on Myspace.\n Line up:\n Szym - vocal, programming\n Hary - acoustic guitar\n Rem - acoustic guitar\n \n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/29769695.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/29769695.jpg", "name": "The Local Skank", "tags": "ska,female vocalist,female fronted ska band", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/The+Local+Skank", "bio_summary": "The Local Skank is a mostly-female, New Orleans-based ska band.", "image_small": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/34/29769695.jpg", "mbid": "", "bio_content": "The Local Skank is a mostly-female, New Orleans-based ska band.\n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "The Magnetic Ear", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/The+Magnetic+Ear", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/71095014.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/71095014.jpg", "name": "The Malah", "tags": "chillout,chill,electronic,jam,under 2000 listeners", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/The+Malah", "bio_summary": "The Malah are a SouthEast based trio who have been captivating ears across the country with their \u2018malahdic\u2019 electro grooves.

They originally decided that James would sing and Robert would play the keyboard because he had taken lessons a few years earlier. They also used the keyboard for drums which became the third &quot;member&quot; of the band, the aptly named, Robot.\n \n In December 2005 the band wrote and recorded several songs but it soon became apparent that James and Robert were better suited at doing each others job so they switched places to form the line-up that we know today. Robert took over vocal responsibilities and James (who was fast becoming quite a talented pianist) switched to playing the keyboard whilst the Robot remained on drums.\n \n In early 2006 The Mumbles wrote a batch of songs and rehearsed them in their school's music room. In April the band released their d\u00e9but EP, Another Shade/Slice Of Black which contains four original tracks and two covers on their independent label, Mumbling Release. As a result of dodgy recording equipment and lack of experience the EP is a cacophony of ear shattering rock n' roll. However, after the acquisition of better equipment they re-recorded and released two of the EP's tracks as singles.\n \n In the summer of 2006 The Mumbles released their first full album entitled To Hell In Black which they followed up with three singles and on Oct. 28th made their live d\u00e9but at a local party.\n \n The band then fell silent for almost a year with the exception of two live dates.\n \n On October 23rd 2007 The Mumbles made their radio d\u00e9but on Hayes FM. The presenters of the station's 'Infernal Racket' show asked the band to cover a song as part of their 'Version Excursion' feature. As the show championed modern indie music it was decided that they'd cover an indie track in their own unique style. The song chosen was 'Martell' by The Cribs. The band completely turned the song on it's head and transformed it from an indie anthem to an atmospheric ballad. The song was later remastered and released on The Wire EP.\n \n In November 2007 the band released a single to mark two years since their formation. The Machine can be downloaded here and was the band's first release in more than a year - now that's quality control in action!\n \n \n During the Christmas period Robert recorded some vocals for an electro-goth collaborative project called Dark Horizon. Their EP, Gold, Blood And Glory - featuring his vocals - was released on May 9th 2008 by Black Heat Records. To download it click here.\n \n On January 12th 2008 The Mumbles signed to the independent label Black Heat Records and released the long awaited EP The Wire on February 29th. During May the band spent four weeks at the top of the Cathedral13 radio chart with their Sisters Of Mercy cover, Crash And Burn. Later in September they made their official live d\u00e9but by headlining the monthly Musical Circus at the White Bear Pub, Rickmansworth (see the entire gig here), and in December the pair were interviewed by Mick Mercer and appeared in issues 45 and 46 of The Mick. \n \n In May 2009 The Mumbles once again returned to the music scene and released a one-track single entitled &quot;Night Train&quot;; a rocking precursor to their upcoming album. With fresh sounds, an expanded line-up, and the confidence to release the single through the most popular online stores, the band once again proved that they were not dead... but dreaming.\n \n After careful consideration the band decided to depart from Black Heat Records in July 2009. The record label served The Mumbles well, however with their new album on the horizon and the search for a commercial deal as one of their aims, they dropped all association with the label  to avoid confusion (with the exception of webpages regarding previous BHR releases [&quot;The Wire&quot; EP, &quot;The Machine&quot; single]).\n \n All records will be released through Mumbling Release until further notice. \n \n On November 30th 2009 The Mumbles released &quot;The Dust Left Behind&quot; on CD and Download to a host of exciting reviews (&quot;album of the year&quot; - Mick Mercer). Stylistically it was a progression from 2008's &quot;The Wire&quot; and followed the rules set out by &quot;Night Train&quot;. This was their first record to receive a full CD release.\n \n Order directly from Mumbling Release today for the best deal!\n \n \n &quot;If they're this good now they could grow into something immense...

The group\u2019s combination of danceable rock and soulful songwriting (and brilliantivity) comes to life through a meticulously crafted and ever-evolving live performance. The band has been instrumental in the growth of New Orleans\u2019 burgeoning indie rock scene, and they have achieved success and notoriety in the city\u2019s competitive musical landscape.\n The Revivalists have proven themselves as a live act. In a short time they have managed to advance from low-profile local gigs to extensive touring, developing a loyal fan base at home and across the Gulf Coast Region and gaining footholds nationally. Abroad, they have commanded such venues as The Kennedy Center (Washington, DC), Sullivan Hall (New York City), Toad\u2019s Place (New Haven, CT), and Smith\u2019s Olde Bar (Atlanta, GA). At home, The Revivalists are regulars at The Howlin\u2019 Wolf, The Republic, and the legendary Tipitina\u2019s. They have shared stages with such notable acts as Perpetual Groove, Marco Benevento, Rebirth Brass Band, Ivan Neville\u2019s Dumpstaphunk, The Lee Boys and Snarky Puppy. Additionally, they have established themselves as an engaging festival act, winning over audiences at French Quarter Fest, Crawfest and Foburg Festival in New Orleans, Hamstock Barbecue and Music Festival in Ridgeland, MS, and The Duke Ellington Jazz Festival in Washington, DC. Most recently, The Revivalists played the 2010 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. There, they caught the attention of Rolling Stone senior editor David Fricke, who wrote about their performance on his blog on rollingstone.com.\n The Revivalists have also grown as studio musicians. Their first release was listed as an editor\u2019s pick in both the Jam and American Traditional Rock categories on CDBaby.com, despite being a humble five-song EP. Their second release, Vital Signs, is both the band\u2019s first full-length album and a significant step forward in terms of production and scale. The young band was privileged to record under the guidance of Grammy Award-winning producer Chris Finney, whose resum\u00e9 ranges from Dr. John to R.E.M. Vital Signs is the result of this collaboration. Soon after its release, Vital Signs became the top-selling album on CDBaby in the American Traditional Rock category, and was quickly selected to be featured in their newsletter. Experience The Revivalists. Understand brilliantivity. And prepare yourself, for your very life will soon have meaning.

Vance, of Croatian nationality, was raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. Little is known about Vance's personal life, but at one point became a high school teacher, and had even found time to write a children's book and poetry in his later years.\n \n Founded in a New Orleans French Quarter Bourbon Street club in 1971, one of the Valiants' most notable characteristics is the audience interaction and style of frontman Vance, who also serves as the band's keyboardist. The band is also known for its theatrical stage antics, with props such as a 6-foot head in Vance's likeness, and a John Deere five-wheel tricycle. Vance himself has 50 complete costume changes for each show.\n \n The group is also known for its still-controversial 1980 song entitled &quot;Bomb Iran&quot;, which was recorded in the midst of the Iranian hostage crisis and sung to the tune of &quot;Barbara Ann&quot; by The Beach Boys and The Regents. &quot;Bomb Iran&quot; was &quot;The Most Requested Song in the United States&quot;, according to Billboard Magazine, in 1980 for several weeks during the heighth of the Iranian Hostage Crisis, garnering much radio play and millions of dollars worth of free publicity [Newsweek, US News &amp; World Report, Playboy, Rolling Stone, etc.] for the band and its already notorious live stage antics.\n \n In October, 1982, the Valiants were decimated by a head-on van crash outside of Palestine, Texas, which took the life of multi-talented Lead Guitarist Richard Heath, as well as the life of the driver of the other vehicle, who had fallen asleep at the wheel on his way in to work at 5am. All six surviving members of the Valiants were severely injured [Stone, Arroyo, Phistry, Gunnstaks, Manousos, and Blanchard], and the group was temporarily sidelined due to those massive injuries until late February of 1983. The crash made the national news wire services, and various benefits were conducted by sponsoring clubs around the country to raise funds to help the band members pay their rent until they could crawl back on stage. The Valiants finally hit the road again in February and have been honored to receive Texas Music Awards for &quot;Best Pop Band 1982&quot; and numerous local magazine awards for &quot;Best Live Show(s)&quot; over the years. They became regulars at the mammoth State Fair of Texas, and were on regular speaking terms with &quot;BIG TEX&quot; himself, who stood in front of the Valiants' stage at the state fairgrounds in Dallas, Texas. The group also performed at The Louisiana World's Fair in New Orleans in 1984 on the outside Coliseum Stage, and annually played at various massive Mardi Gras Celebrations and Parades in New Orleans, while typically performing live shows approximately 300 days/nights per year, in venues ranging in size from private parties to The New Orleans Superdome across forty-two (42) states and Canada, as of 1986. Performance Magazine named The Valiants as &quot;the highest-paid non-major label act in the [music] business&quot; throughout the 1980s.\n \n After restructuring the band and re-vamping the show for a wider mainstream audience in 1986, which included the return of The Valiantettes for the first time since 1974, in 1989 the group produced its biggest hit, &quot;All I Want For Christmas Is You&quot;, which was sung by then-lead singer Lisa Layne. A video was made for the song in 1993. For many years, Billboard Magazine reported this song as Radio's most-requested Christmas song.[citation needed] The song receives heavy holiday airplay on both adult contemporary and country music radio stations annually; in addition, it charted several times on the Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart, reaching as high as #31 in 2000.\n \n &quot;All I Want For Christmas Is You&quot; was written by Vance and former lead guitarist Troy Powers and inspired by one of Vance's real life experiences. Also, the melody of the song is nearly identical to Bobby Vinton's 1964 top 10 pop hit single, &quot;My Heart Belongs to Only You.&quot; The single, first released in 1989 on a vinyl 45, came in a picture jacket with a photo of the band on the front, and on the back was the story that Vance told which inspired him to write the song.[citation needed] Since then, the group has performed at the White House and Vince has even met the Pope.\n \n Later, in 2003, the group recorded a song called &quot;Bomb Iraq&quot;, sung to the tune of &quot;Yakety Yak&quot; and supporting the imminent Iraq war. Vince Vance &amp; The Valiants have also been inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame, among numerous other significant honors.\n \n In early 2007, then-Presidential Candidate Senator John McCain [R-Az.] was video-recorded on a cellphone at a campaign rally singing the words to the Valiants' 1980 hit recording &quot;Bomb Iran&quot; in response to an audience-member's question as to what the candidate's position was regarding Iranian interference in Iraq. This video clip was posted to online video services and resulted in unexpected exposure for both the candidate and The Valiants. As a direct result, the notorious 1980s-era Valiants will indeed be performing a Reunion in Dallas, Texas, along with a set performed by the current line-up of &quot;Vince Vance &amp; The Valiants With The Valiantettes&quot; on November 15th, 2008, as well as a third set comprised of other former Valiants from earlier and later incarnations of this long-lived and persistent touring group.\n \n \n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Viper Mad", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Viper+Mad", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/28498485.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/28498485.jpg", "name": "Vivaz", "tags": "rock,soft rock,alternative,under 2000 listeners", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Vivaz", "bio_summary": "Vivaz, nicht zu verwechseln mit die Vivaz, gibt es seit Fr\u00fchling 2008.

Other members included legendary Tower of Power drummer David Garibaldi, well-known L.A. arranger/orchestrator Chris Boardman on keyboards, bassist Jerry Watts Jr., and Dave Shank on vibes and percussion. During its final year, drummer Vinnie Colaiuta and keyboardist Mitchel Forman joined the group for its last recording (&quot;That Was Then&quot;) and what was to be the band's only European appearance; the 1990 North Sea Jazz Festival.\n \n Wishful Thinking released four recordings featuring original compositions between 1985 and 1990. It's debut album &quot;Wishful Thinking&quot;, endorsed by Steely Dan's Walter Becker, hit Radio &amp; Records' Top Ten Jazz chart in February of 1986. It's follow-up album &quot;Think Again&quot; also reached &quot;Top Ten&quot; status the next year and was the group's first recording to chart in Billboard and Cashbox as well. &quot;Way Down West&quot;; their third and perhaps best known work, was released in late 1988; not only reaching Top Ten airplay status, but in March of 1989, went &quot;Top Ten&quot; on the Billboard Top Contemporary Jazz album sales chart. Wishful Thinking released its' fourth and final recording &quot;That Was Then&quot; in the fall of 1990. A review of that CD, which hails &quot;an album as lively and uninhibited as it is melodic and accessible&quot; would accurately describe the band's entire body of work.\n \n &quot;Train Of Thought&quot; chronicles the Best of Wishful Thinking; a collection featuring twelve of the band's most popular selections, digitally re-mastered from the original recordings. Through it's four previously released albums, it's numerous live radio broadcasts, jazz festival appearances and concert/club performances; Wishful Thinking defined the cutting edge of the West Coast contemporary jazz movement.\n \n Fan appreciation and Jazz/NAC radio support remain strong even today; 18 years after the group played it's last note at the 1990 North Sea Jazz Festival! This can best be attributed to the lasting spirit and quality of the bands' music; once again made available in this compilation CD: &quot;Train Of Thought.&quot;\n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Wyndham Baird", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Wyndham+Baird", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "", "image_medium": "", "name": "Yelephants", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Yelephants", "bio_summary": "", "image_small": "", "mbid": "", "bio_content": ""}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/23142279.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/23142279.jpg", "name": "Yonder Mountain String Band", "tags": "bluegrass,jam,jam band,acoustic,newgrass", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Yonder+Mountain+String+Band", "bio_summary": "Yonder Mountain String Band Biography, June 2009\n  \n Yonder Mountain String Band has always played music by its own set of rules.

Bending bluegrass, rock and countless other influences that the band cites, Yonder has pioneered a sound of their own.  With their traditional lineup of  instruments, the band may look like a traditional bluegrass band at first glance but they\u2019ve created their own music that transcends any genre.  Dave Johnston points out \u201cWhat could be more pure than making your own music.\u201d  Yonder\u2019s sound cannot be classified purely as \u201cbluegrass\u201d or \u201cstring music\u201d but rather it\u2019s an original sound created from \u201clooking at music from [their] own experiences and doing the best job possible.\u201d  The band continues to play by their own rules on their new record The Show.\n \n The Colorado-based foursome has crisscrossed the country over the past eleven years playing such varied settings as festivals, rock clubs, Red Rocks Amphitheater in the band\u2019s home state, and recently the Democratic National Convention in Denver at Mile High Stadium opening for Barack Obama.  Their loyal fanbase has been built from this diverse setting of music venues as fans latched on to their genre-defying original sound.\n  \n In between tours the band spent time this last year working on its fifth studio album. Set for a September 1 release on the band\u2019s own label, The Show is the second album with rock producer Tom Rothrock (Beck, Elliott Smith, Foo Fighters). While some might scratch their heads as to why a string band would want a rock producer, this decision was a natural choice for the band.  \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of nostalgia for the past,\u201d says banjo player Dave Johnston. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t try to recreate the 1940s. I like to think of us as informed by the past and all the great performers before us. But we also want to look forward rather than give people something that has already been perfected.\u201d\n  \n The Show has the similar acoustic instrumentation (Adam Aijala on guitar, Johnston on banjo, Jeff Austin on mandolin and Ben Kaufman on bass with all four singing) as many of its classic bluegrass forefathers. Though once again drums are present (as with the self-titled fourth album) with the great Pete Thomas of Elvis Costello\u2019s bands adding a rhythmic backdrop to Yonder\u2019s still-acoustic sound on six of the tracks. The record consists of thirteen songs all written by Yonder.\n   \n The band has long cited such varied influences as the bluegrass of Del McCoury, Johnson Mountain Boys, Jimmy Martin, Bill Monroe, Osborne Brothers as well as the punk rock of Bad Religion, Black Flag and the Dead Kennedys.  Somewhere in between these two tent poles are early 20th Century composers and alternative rock bands like Grandaddy and Postal Service. It\u2019s  all funneled through the band\u2019s unique chemistry, honed since they first met at an informal club performance in 1998. With band members writing individually, in different pairings and as a collective, the album proves that this group is a collection of creative peers and you can hear it in the rich tapestry of music that makes up The Show.\n  \n Here Yonder offers such traditional bluegrass sounding fare as \u201cOut Of The Blue\u201d and \u201cCasualty.\u201d The band has explored its country roots in the past and does so again this time on \u201cSteep Grade, Sharp Curves,\u201d a song that describes the roads around its home base in Nederland as well as a particularly dangerous femme fatale.  A little further from the roots is the impressionistic \u201cIsolate\u201d with its simple but ominous bass line and minimal arrangement. There is also a bevy of rockers like \u201cComplicated,\u201d \u201cFingerprints\u201d and \u201cBelle Parker,\u201d a gem of a song about a hard-hearted woman. The band even finds some excellent middle ground between bluegrass and rock on \u201cFine Excuses\u201d thanks in part to a scorching guitar solo from Adam Aijala. There is also the extended \u201cHonestly\u201d -- at eight-minutes, the longest song on the album, with a middle section that is an excellent platform for lengthier live excursions that are as improvisatory as any electric band on the live music circuit.\n  \n The band is a regular at bluegrass festivals like the Telluride Bluegrass Festival and the band's own Northwest String Summit as well as massive multi-stage events like Austin City Limits Festival, Bonnaroo and Rothbury.  Fans are no doubt drawn to Yonder\u2019s anything goes attitude, its humor and passion about music, and the band\u2019s ability to stretch out live.  \u201cWe love that people come to see us,\u201d Johnston points out. \u201cEveryone appreciates good music. Some people want to go to a recital and some people want to party.\u201d\n  \n But as its fans know, Yonder Mountain String Band does something a little different, more than just a musical party. The Show is the band\u2019s most varied and versatile album to date, and the summation of the journey that these guys are on together. It\u2019s bluegrass for the masses, acoustic tunes filled with dazzling chops, and it\u2019s fun to boot. The humble Johnston sounds as surprised as anyone by the band\u2019s success, but knows that it all boiled down to chemistry, which has never changed. \u201cSomewhere down there we all kind of recognized that we had something unique,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut there is no way I could have imagined the amount of success that the band has had.\u201d\n \n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/82702531.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/82702531.jpg", "name": "Young Fellaz Brass Band", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Young+Fellaz+Brass+Band", "bio_summary": "The Young Fellaz Brass Band is a lively second line styled brass band from New Orleans, LA.

Rich with ballads and mid-tempo humidity, the music on this recording is best described as soulful rhythm and blues, with flavors of Al Green, Taj Mahal and Stevie Wonder emerging in the swells, changes and modulations of the music, in the voice and even occasionally in the lyrical content. The record will appeal to fans of contemporary artists like Jack Johnson and Amos Lee, but the origins of the style and feel are classic.\n \n As a boy, the music of Zach Deputy\u2019s Puerto Rican, Cruzan and Irish heritage was cooked up in a South Carolina heat. The Calypso rhythms and folk songs of St. Croix competed with the R&amp;B / soul of pioneers like James Brown and Ray Charles for space on the family stereo. As Deputy honed his craft, a unique hybrid of these influences emerged, ultimately creating the signature Zach Deputy sound. However, when Zach\u2019s manager first turned producer Scott Jacoby on to some of Zach\u2019s more funky, upbeat live performances, Jacoby simply didn\u2019t hear it. The one-man-band live looping show features a more simplified version of Deputy\u2019s music, and Jacoby was looking for songs, structure, changes, hooks, choruses\u2026 stuff that is nearly impossible to do by one\u2019s self on stage with a nylon string Godin acoustic guitar, a handful of mics and a bunch of looping technology. Zach simply showed up at Jacoby\u2019s studio with his acoustic guitar and sang a few songs and Jacoby was inspired\u2014the urban-oriented dance album they had discussed was going to have to wait: he and Zach were going to make what they called a \u201cRay Lamontagne record\u201d.\n \n Recorded over 5 days in August, 2009 at Mission Sound Recording in Brooklyn, NY, Another Day emerged as a warm, mellow album that suits after hours and sunsets. It is possible that the only benefit to recording with a limited budget in a small window of time is that the raw essence of the session is not stripped away by weeks or months of second guessing and revision. The instincts and experience of the players is critical in sessions like this, and Jacoby chose the right guys to fill out the sound of the record.\n \n To handle the ever-present Latin, Caribbean and African elements in Zach Deputy\u2019s backbeat and place them in the contemporary soul / pop format of the songs, Jacoby tapped Graham Hawthorne\u00a0(Aretha Franklin, Harry Belafonte, Joan Osborne, Paul Simon, David Byrne)\u00a0for the drum kit. Bassist Al Carty\u00a0came into the studio and explained to Deputy\u2019s manager that he a little scattered, as he had played four church gigs that day. Despite the list of artists he has recorded or toured with (Lou Reed, Rob Thomas, Alicia Keys, De La Soul, Carrie Underwood, Gavin DeGraw, Me'shell Ndegeocello, Ashanti\u00a0 and more), the church gigs alone proved that Jacoby was on the mark with this choice for the low end. Zach Deputy is, after all, a soul singer whose music is underpinned by Gospel as much as by any other musical idiom.\u00a0 Equally at home in the Gospel tradition, pianist / organist Will Buthod (Jay-Z, Fat Joe, Alicia Keys, Swizz Beatz, Mashonda. The Harlem Gospel Choir) rounded out the studio trio that filled out Deputy\u2019s vision for the recording, a vision made real by Jacoby\u2019s pitch perfect choice of accompanists. These four accomplished professionals met for the first time on the first day of recording and worked as if they were old friends with a shared history and a common purpose.\n \n In contrast to the music and feel of Another Day, Zach Deputy has made his mark as a touring powerhouse.\u00a0The big, impossibly upbeat South Carolinian with the infectious smile puts on a solo\u00a0show-- enhanced by looping technology-- that is essentially a one man dance party offering up\u00a0&quot;Island-infused, drum 'n' bass, Gospel-Ninja-Soul&quot; to the enthusiastic crowd of dancers who pack clubs coast-to-coast. \u00a0It is these late night dance parties\u2014more than 250 per year-- that have made Zach Deputy\u00a0one of the hottest up-and-coming live performers and a favorite\u00a0of the camping festival circuit and \u201cjam band\u201d scene. For Zach, most days begin in a hotel room and end a couple of hours after walking off stage, leaving a packed house of sweaty dancers calling for more. The constant touring and the compelling live show may be the key to Zach\u2019s success on the road, but it is an unlikely inspiration for\u00a0Another Day, as there is little similarity between what fans have come to expect from Zach and what is offered up in this new record.\n \n Thus, Another Day is an appropriately titled album, and it is truly an album in the classic sense\u2014a collection of songs that come from the same time and place, inspired by the same muse. Reflective and introspective, it provides a glimpse at the soul of an artist and the depth of a songwriter. Full of hope and anticipation of the promise of another day, a new day, it is a pivotal point in the career of a touring musician. Whereas it is a departure for Zach Deputy, it is one that he feels confident his fans can relate to, but it isn\u2019t the end in itself. Deputy\u2019s multi-faceted diamond gets one side polished in this offering, and it is a side that will shine brightly for a new audience.\n    \nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."}, {"image_large": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/126/8050737.jpg", "image_medium": "http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/64/8050737.jpg", "name": "Zappa Plays Zappa", "tags": "progressive rock,zappa,rock,awesome guitar jams,alternative rock", "url": "http://www.last.fm/music/Zappa+Plays+Zappa", "bio_summary": "The band debuted in 2006 with shows in Europe, Canada and the United States during May and June (the tour was also known as Zappa Plays Zappa - Tour de Frank').

At several shows Frank Zappa himself performed a song posthumously via synchronized audio/video technology, notedly solos in Chunga's Revenge.\n \n After a break, the band played again in the US during the Fall of 2006, including a show in New York on October 31. This revived Frank Zappa's tradition of playing Halloween shows in New York. A DVD documenting the 2006 tour is planned for release in 2007.[1]\n \n In July and August 2007, the band plays a North American tour, with a core line up similar to that of the 2006 band. The band will thereafter play in Europe during September and October, before returning to the US, starting with another Halloween show in New York. They will end the 2007 tour in Australia in early December.[2] Special guest on the tour is vocalist and guitarist Ray White.[3]\n \n \n Players 2007/2008 tour\n Dweezil Zappa\n Guitar\n \n Guitarist Dweezil Zappa has cocooned himself away in the studio this past year engineering his own metamorphosis. &quot;In order for me to play my father's music correctly I needed to understand the fundamentals of his music more thoroughly, which meant a lot of studying.&quot; His goal was to emerge as a &quot;better musician&quot; as well as a &quot;better guitarist.&quot; The autodidactic Zappa utilized the fruits of his labor to startling effect on his first album project in more than six years - Go With What You Know - featuring a unique guitar rendition of the elder Zappa's classic instrumental, Peaches En Regalia. &quot;I actually played along with Frank's guitar solo from the original 'Hot Rats' master tapes. He had dedicated that album to me since he was working on that around the time I was born. It's cool to hear us playing together note for note in a stereo time machine.&quot;\n \n The album will be independently released to coincide with the &quot;Zappa Plays Zappa&quot; European tour which hits the road this May. This is the first official live concert event of Frank Zappa's Music since his untimely passing in 1993. Joining Dweezil on stage will be a hand-picked band of new, young musicians.\n \n Dweezil has recorded under his own name and with his brother, Ahmet, in their band Z. Six-string heroics aside, Dweezil has nurtured a successful television career, starting early on as an MTV veejay when he was only 17. He has appeared in films (Pretty in Pink, The Running Man with Arnold Schwarzenegger) and composed the music for several television shows including the Ben Stiller Show and the hit WB comedy, The Jamie Kennedy Experiment. In addition to cauterizing his fingertips learning to play the music of Frank Zappa for the upcoming tour, and lending his studio wizardry to the Zappa archives (his multi-channel production work on the recent Frank Zappa release, QuAUDIOPHILIAc, is positively mind-blowing), Dweezil has this to say about his upcoming album,&quot;To me the record is like a weird audio movie. I really tried to create an interesting flow with it.&quot; And the tour rehearsals, &quot;Prepping for the tour has been like preparing for a medieval battle where going into it your sharpest weapon is a spoon. But I'm pretty deadly with that spoon now.&quot;\n Aaron Arntz\n Keyboards &amp; Trumpet\n \n Aaron Arntz is a musical mad scientist, with the pointy beard to prove it. He owes as much of his musical abilities and proclivities to his love of Calculus as he does to twenty-plus years of dedicated cultivation. In 2003, Arntz earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Jazz Studies from the University of Southern California, where he studied jazz piano under like-minded maniacs, such as Alan Pasqua and Bill Cunliffe. He also gleaned a thing or two about composition under Donald Crockett. Over the last six years, many L.A. rock bands (Troika, B.R.A.M., The Red Elvises, Telepathy, and Ascendant) have served as suitable laboratories for Arntz\u2019s sonic experiments, enabling him to showcase his unique talents across the nation.\n Scheila Gonzalez\n Saxophone, Flute, Keyboards &amp; Vocals\n \n Scheila Gonzalez was born in Los Angeles, California on August 5th, 1971. Her mother first enrolled her in piano lessons at the age of four. At the age of twelve she fell in love with the saxophone and she has never looked back. This versatile artist and educator can be heard on numerous recordings and in a variety of musical settings. Scheila has toured throughout Europe and Japan and extensively in the United States. She has had the opportunity to perform in prestigious venues such as Lincoln Center, The Kennedy Center, Carnegie Hall, Walt Disney Hall and the Kodak Theater. Over the years Scheila has performed with Lionel Hampton, Diane Schuur, Joe Williams, Nancy Wilson, Alex Acuna, Billy Davis, Marylin McCoo, Ray Parker Jr. and Billy Preston to name a few.\n \n Some of her television appearances include The Tonight Show with Jay Leno backing up country music artist Garth Brooks and more recently the BET Music Awards with Sheila E. supporting Best Hip-Hop Artist Nominee T.I. She will soon be seen in the new Christopher Guest film &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; scheduled for release this Fall.\n \n Scheila is an exceptional performer who embraces opportunities to play in diverse musical situations. Scheila's skills on woodwinds, keyboards and vocals keep her in demand. She thrives on the challenge and her passion for life is felt in every note she plays. Regardless of what style or instrument she's playing, every phrase is soulful and she performs with the ease of a true professional. She approaches all of her musical endeavors with great joy and if you ask her you will find that Scheila feels extremely blessed to get to do what she does.\n Pete Griffin\n Bass\n \n Griffin grew up outside of New York and has been playing music since he was young. He began on the trumpet during elementary school, but it wasn't until he received his first bass in the seventh grade that his passion was fully ignited. Soon he was playing with his high school's jazz band, and then eventually his local All-County and All-State jazz bands.\n \n Unfortunately, tragedy would compel Griffin to make music his life's calling. In 1996, Griffin's friend and teacher, Dan Binggeli, died at the age of nineteen. For a time, Pete's only comfort was in playing music. Soon, Griffin was asked to join Uncle Funkle, Binggeli's band, and he decided to seize the chance for a life in music Binggeli never had.\n \n To help guide his new found sense of direction, Griffin chose to further study his craft. He was accepted to Northwestern University's well-known School of Music outside of Chicago. There he was deeply immersed in the study of jazz and classical, while also taking lessons under Steve Rodby of the influential jazz outfit The Pat Metheny Group. From him, Griffin learned to concentrate on playing less notes and making them count more.\n \n Graduating in 2001 with a B.A. in Music, Griffin immediately moved to Los Angeles. Eventually, he began to work at the Musician's Institute as a teacher's assistant, as well as attending every audition he heard about. After playing a few shows with Save Ferris's Monique Powell, Griffin began to play bass for Hanson in 2003, touring the US and Asia in 2004 and appearing on several TV shows including The Tonight Show, The Today Show, and Good Morning America. In 2005 Pete played on Hanson's live album &quot;Live and Electric,&quot; in addition to playing a few shows with the Edgar Winter Band. In early 2006 Pete was picked to play for the Zappa Plays Zappa tour with Dweezil Zappa, Steve Vai and others.\n Billy Hulting\n Marimba, Mallets &amp; Percussion\n \n Billy was born with non-violent inclinations. He was also born with an extreme desire to hit things. He did, at an early age, find some common ground in this dichotomy in the world of percussion. After eleven years, the tolerating Mr. and Mrs. Hulting agreed to let him start with the drums. Music led him to college at California State University at Northridge where he got a Bachelor of Music Degree in the Studio Music Option (so what if it took six years). Two weeks after graduation he went on the road with Maynard Ferguson\u2019s High Voltage 2. He later toured with Maynard\u2019s 60th Birthday Big Band and recorded albums with both groups. During the Maynard days he did the Nia Peeples tour of Japan. He then toured for two years with Natalie Cole followed by Barry Manilow.\n \n Billy had been touring for over thirteen years with Lou Rawls until he passed away recently. In the last few years Billy also toured with The Rippingtons, Patti Labelle, and The Manhattan Transfer. Billy also co-wrote one of the songs on their CD &quot;Vibrate.&quot; He is now touring with Zappa Plays Zappa - a band led by Dweezil Zappa performing the music of Frank Zappa. Several years ago Billy released his first CD - The Hundredth Monkey on the Truemedia label. He has worked with many others including Clare Fisher, Luci Arnaz, and Howard Hewitt. Billy also stays busy in town doing shows, sessions, playing with his trio and his fusion group. His hobbys include sailing, SCUBA diving, skating in-line marathons, and cooking spicy vegan foods from all over the world (his Jamaican Jerk Marinade is not for the weak).\n Jamie Kime\n Guitar\n \n A native of San Diego, CA., guitarist Jamie Kime attended the Musician\u2019s Institute in Hollywood, CA., studied improv privately with Peter Sprague and harmony with Ted Greene, and has performed, recorded, and/or toured with Jewel, Michelle Branch, and legendary Austin, Texas-based blues/soul vocalist Malford Milligan in The Boneshakers, and many other amazing artists that, according to Jamie, \u201cyou\u2019ve probably never heard of\u201d. When he\u2019s home in Los Angeles, he hosts a weekly Monday night gig at the world famous Baked Potato.\n \n On his gig with ZPZ, Jamie says, \u201cUpon being asked by Dweezil to be a part of the band, I knew it would be equal parts challenging and rewarding. But, I had no idea how much of a junkie I would become for this music. I\u2019m now constantly searching Frank\u2019s vast catalog for new songs to learn in addition to periodically revisiting the songs we\u2019ve been playing for months now, every time discovering new things I hadn\u2019t heard before. Every musician should take some time to immerse themselves in the music of Frank Zappa - you\u2019ll be hooked for life, and be a better player for it!\u201d\n Joe Travers\n Drums &amp; Vocals\n \n From Erie, PA. Schooled at The Berklee College Of Music from 1988-1992. Drummer for numerous live outfits over the years including but not limited to Z (Ahmet &amp; Dweezil Zappa), Duran Duran, Billy Idol, Lisa Loeb and Drake Bell. Vaultmeister for the Zappa Family Trust since 1995. Currently drumming with Zappa Plays Zappa.\n SPECIAL GUESTS:\n \n Ray White\n Guitar and Vocals\n \n Ray White is a rock and blues guitarist most well-known as a member of Frank Zappa's touring ensembles. He was drafted into Zappa's band in the fall of 1976, being featured on rhythm guitar and vocals. He participated on such albums as Zappa in New York (featuring a powerful lead vocal on &quot;The Illinois Enema Bandit&quot;), Tinsel Town Rebellion, and You Are What You Is amongst others in Zappa's voluminous catalogue.\n \n Ray has also worked with jam-oriented groups like KVHW, Don't Push the Clown and Umphrey's McGee since his contributions to the Zappa band, and has more recently worked with a variety of Michigan artists, including former Rare Earth Drummer Bob Weaver, as well as members of the funk/fusion combo Generic Produce.\n \n  \n   \t\n \t\n Grand Rights, Project/Object \t\n \n Copyright \u00a9 mmvi. zft.
