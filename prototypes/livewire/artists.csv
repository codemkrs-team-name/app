Neslort,,"Neslort is the brainchild and muse of one of New Orleans’ most versatile musicians: trombonist and composer Rick Trolsen. While the name derived from spelling his family name backwards, Neslort is the forward moving thread connecting a dynamic musical career. In fact, Trolsen’s lifework and projects are so varied across the spectrum of New Orleans music, that he is sometimes referred to as “a one-man Jazz Festival.” Perhaps that is why so many genres now find a hospitable, albeit alternative, home within Neslort’s self-styled “Primordial Fusion.” ",http://www.last.fm/music/Neslort,,,http://www.last.fm/music/Neslort

A 3 song demo is set to be released in February 2011, followed by a 3 week East Coast tour at the beginning of the summer.
