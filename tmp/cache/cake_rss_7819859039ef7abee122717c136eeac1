<p>For my inaugural post, I thought I&#8217;d talk about clouds.<br />
Specifically, the animated clouds you may have noticed scrolling in the background.<br />
I do a lot of work for a lot of people, but I don&#8217;t get many opportunities to implement animated clouds.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get many opportunities to implement animated anything.<br/><br />
And that&#8217;s a shame.<br/><br />
Because movement is fun.</p>
<p>So I decided when building this website for myself that I wanted to make something move.</p>
<p>And then I had an idea.<br/><br />
I thought: what happens when you change the background position of a background image that&#8217;s set to repeat?<br/><br />
I hoped it would scroll infinitely.<br/><br />
And it turns out that&#8217;s exactly what it does.</p>
<p>The relevant code is below, and turns out to be an extremely easy way to do background animation.</p>

<p>In my next post I think I&#8217;ll talk about the incredible icon font sets available from <a href="http://icomoon.io/">icomoon</a>, and why you should be using them for your icon needs.</p>
<p>Because playing with icon font sets was the second funnest thing I did while making this site.</p>";s:14:"wfw:commentRss";s:69:"http://specialgoodstuff.com/wordpress/2012/10/making-clouds-move/feed";s:14:"slash:comments";s:1:"0";}s:9:"atom:link";a:3:{s:5:"@href";s:42:"http://specialgoodstuff.com/wordpress/feed";s:4:"@rel";s:4:"self";s:5:"@type";s:19:"application/rss+xml";}s:15:"sy:updatePeriod";s:6:"hourly";s:18:"sy:updateFrequency";s:1:"1";}}}";
